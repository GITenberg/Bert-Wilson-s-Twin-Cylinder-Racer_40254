<p class="cap">&ldquo;Stop her. Stop her. She&rsquo;s running wild!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cry ended almost in a shriek that rang
high above the murmur of voices at the railroad
station.</p>

<p>It was a bright sunny morning early in June.
The usual crowd of rustics had gathered at the depot
to see the train come in and depart. A few
commercial travelers were consulting time tables
and attending to the disposition of their baggage.
Gay laughter and hasty farewells arose from a bevy
of girls and the young men who had assembled to
see them off. The conductor, watch in hand, stood
ready to give the signal, and the black porters were
already gathering up the folding steps preparatory
to boarding the train. The bells were ringing and
the whistle had given its preliminary toot, when
all were startled at the sight of the station agent,
who issued wild-eyed from his office and ran on the
track, frantically waving his hands and shouting at
the top of his voice.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>As the startled passengers and trainmen followed
the direction of his look, they saw what had
occasioned the wild commotion, and, for a moment,
their hearts stood still.</p>

<p>A big Mogul engine that had been shunted to a
side track was moving down the line, slowly at first
but gathering speed with every passing second.
Neither engineer nor fireman could be seen in the
cab. It was evident that they had left before the
power was completely shut off, or that some sudden
jar had started the mechanism. Even while the
frightened spectators watched as though under a
spell, the pace grew swifter. Some of the men
lounging about the roundhouse made a hurried
rush for it, with a faint hope of getting aboard and
shutting off steam. One of these made a desperate
grab at the rear end of the tender, but was flung
in a ditch alongside the track, where he rolled
over and over. It was too late to stop her. Amid
a tempest of yells and a tumult of excitement she
gathered way and sped down the line.</p>

<p>The station master wrung his hands and tore his
hair in desperation. For the moment he was
crazed with fright.</p>

<p>A clear eyed young fellow, tall, stalwart, muscular,
had been chatting with a party of friends on
the road beside the platform. While he talked, his
hand rested on the handle-bars of a motorcycle at
which he glanced at intervals with a look of pride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
that was almost affection. It was a superb machine,
evidently of the latest type, and in its graceful
lines suggested in some vague way a resemblance
to its owner. Both looked like thoroughbreds.</p>

<p>At the Babel of cries that rent the air the young
motorcyclist looked up and his nostrils dilated with
sudden purpose. At a glance he took in the situation&mdash;the
running men, the panic cries, the runaway
engine. Then he came plunging through the
crowd and grasped the dazed agent by the shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, wake up,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Do something.
Telegraph to the next station.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man looked up dully. Terror had benumbed
his faculties. He was clearly not the man
for a sudden emergency.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No use,&rdquo; he moaned. &ldquo;The next station is
thirteen miles away. And it&rsquo;s a single track,&rdquo; he
wailed, &ldquo;and No. 56 is due in twenty minutes. If
she&rsquo;s on time she&rsquo;s already left there. They&rsquo;ll meet
head-on&mdash;O God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quick,&rdquo; the newcomer commanded, as he fairly
dragged him into the office. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the key. Get
busy. Call up the next station and see if you can
stop 56.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But as he saw the aimless, paralyzed way in
which the agent fumbled at the key, he thrust him
aside and took his place. He was an expert telegrapher,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
and his fingers fairly flew as he called up
the operator at Corridon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Engine running wild,&rdquo; he called. &ldquo;Stop 56 and
sidetrack the runaway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A moment of breathless suspense and the answer
came in sharp, staccato clicks that betrayed the agitation
of the man at the other end.</p>

<p>&ldquo;56 just left. Rounding the curve half a mile
away. Making up time, too. For heaven&rsquo;s sake,
do something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do something.&rdquo; What bitter irony! What
could be done? Death was at the throttle of that
mad runaway rushing down the line.</p>

<p>But the young fellow was of the never say die
kind, and always at his best when danger threatened.
He thought with the rapidity of lightning.
Then he clutched the station agent, who sat with
his head bowed on his hands, a picture of abject
misery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there a switch between here and Corridon?&rdquo;
he demanded fiercely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;N-no,&rdquo; muttered the stupefied man. &ldquo;That is,
there is one at the old stone quarry, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The remainder of the sentence fell on empty
air. Like a flash, the youth who had so cavalierly
taken matters in his own hands was out of the
room. He ploughed through the huddled group
of passengers and trainmen, and flung himself into
the saddle of the waiting motorcycle. A roar as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
threw in the clutch, a quick scattering of those in
front, and the machine, like a living thing, darted
down the road that lay beside the track.</p>

<p>The wind sang in his ears and the path fell away
behind him as he crouched low over the fork so that
his body might offer as little resistance as possible.
And, as he rushed along, his active mind was thinking&mdash;thinking&mdash;</p>

<p>He knew the surrounding country like an open
book. There was scarcely a lane that he had not
threaded, and as for the highways, he had gone
over them again and again. Now, as in a panorama,
he saw every turn and bend, every height and
hollow of the road that lay before him. In sheer
delight of living he had ridden it before; now he
must do it to keep others from dying.</p>

<p>The old stone quarry was a familiar landmark.
More than once, he and other fellows from the
College interested in geology had come over there
to hunt fossils. At an earlier date, it had been a
buzzing hive of activity, and a side track had been
laid by the railroad company in order to load the
stone more easily. But of late it had proved unprofitable
to work the quarry, and nothing now remained
but the abandoned shacks of the workmen
and some broken tools and machinery, rusting in
the grass that had grown up around them. He remembered
that the siding ran for about twenty rods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and ended at bumpers set within a few feet of the
wall of rock.</p>

<p>For two or three miles, the road he was traveling
ran almost parallel to the railroad. At times,
a shoulder of the path hid the rails from sight, and
at one place he had to make quite a wide detour before
he again came close to the right of way. The
switch at the quarry was seven miles from the town,
and, though he hoped to make it in less than that
many minutes, it seemed as though he would never
reach it. To his agonized mind he appeared to be
merely crawling. In reality he was flying.</p>

<p>For he was riding now as he had never ridden
before. Human life was at stake&mdash;perhaps hundreds
of lives. He pictured the long line of cars
full of passengers&mdash;for 56 was the road&rsquo;s finest
train, and almost always filled to capacity&mdash;coming
toward him without a thought of danger. Some
would be reading, others gazing out of the windows,
still others laughing and talking. But everywhere
would be confidence, ease of mind, an eager
looking for the journey&rsquo;s end without the slightest
apprehension. And all this time, death was grimly
bearing down upon them in one of his most fearful
forms.</p>

<p>He shuddered as in his mind&rsquo;s eye he saw the
two monster locomotives leaping at each other like
enraged giants. He had seen a wreck once and
had fervently prayed that he might never see another.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
And as that scene now came before him,
he bent lower over the bars and let out every ounce
of speed that the machine possessed.</p>

<p>It was leaping now, only touching the high
places. Had he been a less skilful rider he would
have been hurled from the saddle. Discretion was
thrown to the winds. It was no time to measure
possibilities or look out for his personal safety. He
had to take chances. His siren warned all comers
to give him the road. A team was hauled up on its
haunches by the frightened driver; an automobile
drew so hastily to one side that two wheels went
into the ditch. He caught a glimpse of startled
faces at doors and windows as he passed. Like a
meteor he flashed by, all his heart and soul wrapped
up in the thought of rescue.</p>

<p>Now he had overtaken the locomotive and was
running parallel to it. The Mogul swayed and
lurched as it tore along with all steam up on its
mission of destruction. Steadily the rider drew up
on even terms, with less than twenty feet separating
the tracks from the high road. Then the motorcycle
swept into the lead and increased it with every
bound.</p>

<p>Only two miles more to the quarry! His heart
exulted as he realized that he would get there first.
But the margin would be fearfully close. The
switch might prove rusty and refuse to work. Some
part of it might be out of gear. For years it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
been utterly abandoned. What a bitter jest of
fate if, after reaching it ahead of the locomotive,
he should have to stand helplessly by and see it
dash past on its errand of slaughter.</p>

<p>Then, too, a third factor entered into the problem.
There was No. 56. She was a limited express
and famous for her speed. The operator at
Corridon had said that on this stretch of road, supposed
to be clear, she would make up time. If she
reached and passed the switch before the runaway,
no power on earth could prevent a frightful disaster.
And just then, while this fear was tugging at
his heart, a faint whistle in the distance drove all
the color from his face. 56 was coming!</p>

<p>He dared not take his eyes from the road in
front, but he knew from the lessened noise behind
him that he was increasing his lead. And then as
he swept around a slight curve in the road, the abandoned
quarry came into view. There were the
empty shacks, the deserted platform and, a few
rods further on, the switch.</p>

<p>He raced to the tracks and threw himself from
the machine, almost falling headlong from the momentum,
although he had turned off the power.
Then he grasped the lever and tried to throw the
switch.</p>

<p>It groaned and creaked, but, although it protested,
it yielded to the powerful young muscles
that would not be denied. But, when it had moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
two-thirds of the way it balked, and, despite his
frenzied attempts, refused to budge another inch.
And now the runaway engine was coming close,
rumbling and roaring hideously, while round the
curve, a scant quarter of a mile away, appeared the
smokestack of No. 56.</p>

<p>Looking wildly about for the obstacle, he saw
that a stone had been wedged into the frog. He
tried to remove it, but the turning of the switch had
jammed it against the rail. Straightening up, he
swung the lever far enough back to release the
stone. He worked as if in a nightmare. Fifty feet
away, the Mogul was bearing down like a fire-breathing
demon. With one swift movement he
threw the stone aside; with the next he bowed his
back over the lever until it felt as though it would
break. Then the rusted rails groaned into place;
with an infernal din and uproar the runaway took
the switch. Scarcely had it cleared the track when
56 thundered past, its wheels sending out streams
of sparks as the brakes ground against them.</p>

<p>The Mogul struck the bumpers with terrific
force, tore them away and leaped headlong against
the wall of the quarry. There was a crash that
could be heard for miles, and the wrecked locomotive
reared into the air and then rolled over on its
side, enveloped in smoke and hissing steam.</p>

<p>As soon as the long train of 56 could be stopped,
the throttle was reversed and it came gliding back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
to the switch. The engineer and fireman sprang
from their cab, conductor and trainmen came running
up, and the passengers swarmed from the
cars.</p>

<p>There was a tumult of excited questionings, as
they gathered round the young fellow who stood
there, panting with the strain of his tremendous
efforts. Now that he had succeeded in the forlorn
hope that he had undertaken, he was beginning
to feel the reaction. He responded briefly and
modestly to the questions that were showered upon
him, and, as the full meaning of their narrow escape
from death burst upon them, passengers and
trainmen alike were loud in their praise of his presence
of mind and thanks for their deliverance.
They were for making him a hero, but he shrank
from this and would have none of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t thank me,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;It was this
that made it possible;&rdquo; and he patted the handlebars
of the motorcycle. &ldquo;She certainly did herself
proud this day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She surely is a dandy,&rdquo; smiled the conductor,
&ldquo;but you must admit that you had a <i>little</i> to do
with it. We&rsquo;ll never forget what you have done
for us to-day. But now we must be starting.
We&rsquo;ll put the machine in the baggage car, and you
come in here with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A blast of the whistle and No. 56 had resumed
its interrupted journey.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>A ringing cheer burst from the anxious crowds
that surged about the platform as the great train,
puffing and snorting, came into the station. The
agent, white as a ghost, could not believe his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I thought it was all
over. I&rsquo;ve telegraphed for the wrecking crew, and
all the doctors in town have been called to go along.
How on earth did you escape? Where is the
Mogul?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find that down in the quarry smashed
to bits,&rdquo; answered the conductor. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need the
wrecking train for that, all right, but you can call
off the doctors. We would have needed plenty of
them&mdash;and undertakers too&mdash;if it hadn&rsquo;t been for
this young man. He threw the switch without a
second to spare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The station agent grasped the rider&rsquo;s hand and
stammered and stuttered, as he tried to pour out his
thanks. But just then a flying wedge of college
boys came through the crowd and, grabbing the reluctant
hero, hoisted him to their shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wilson.&rdquo; &ldquo;Bert Wilson.&rdquo; &ldquo;O, you Bert.&rdquo;
&ldquo;O, you speed boy,&rdquo; they yelled. The enthusiastic
lookers on took up the shout and it was a long time
before Bert, blushing and embarrassed, could free
himself from his boisterous admirers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, cut it out, fellows,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;It was
all in the day&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; assented Tom Henderson, &ldquo;but <i>such</i> a
day&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And such a worker,&rdquo; added Dick Trent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three times three and a tiger for Bert Wilson,&rdquo;
roared a stentorian voice. The answer came
in a tempest of cheers, and, as the train pulled out,
the last sound that came to the waving passengers
was the lusty chorus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Which nobody can deny.&rdquo;</span>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo;</span></h3>


<p class="cap">&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a beauty?&rdquo; exclaimed Bert, as, a few
days later, he swept up to a waiting group of
friends and leaped from the saddle.</p>

<p>There was a unanimous assent as the boys
crowded around the motorcycle, looking at it almost
with the rapt intentness of worshippers at a
shrine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a dandy, all right,&rdquo; declared Dick, with an
enthusiasm equal to Bert&rsquo;s own. &ldquo;You skimmed
along that last stretch of road like a bird.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about the speediest and niftiest thing on
the planet,&rdquo; chimed in Tom. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d give an airship
all it wanted to do to keep up with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy, easy there,&rdquo; laughed Bert. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
go as far as that. But on &lsquo;terra cotta,&rsquo; as Mrs.
Partington calls it, there are mighty few things
that will make me take their dust.&rdquo; And he patted
the machine with as much affection as if it could
feel and respond to the touch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About how fast can that streak of greased
lightning travel, any way?&rdquo; asked Drake. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the record for a motorcycle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The best so far is a mile in thirty-six and four-fifths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
seconds,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s at the
rate of ninety-eight miles an hour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some traveling,&rdquo; murmured Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; went on Bert, &ldquo;that was for a
sprint. But even over long distances some great
records have been hung up. In England last year
a motorcycle made 300 miles in 280 minutes. I
don&rsquo;t think the fastest express train in the world
has ever beaten that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate to be in the path of
a cannon ball like that. It would be the &lsquo;sweet by
and by&rsquo; for yours truly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might possibly muss you up some,&rdquo; grinned
Bert. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a case of &lsquo;the quick or the dead&rsquo; when
you amble across the path of a twin-cylinder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think,&rdquo; remarked Drake, &ldquo;that it
would shake the daylights out of you to travel at
the speed you were going just now along that last
bit of road.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A few years ago it would have,&rdquo; admitted Bert.
&ldquo;The way they bumped along was a sure cure for
dyspepsia. But with this saddle I could ride all
day and scarcely feel a jar. Why, look at this
cradle spring frame,&rdquo; he went on enthusiastically;
&ldquo;it has the same flat leaf springs that they use in
the finest kind of automobiles. You wouldn&rsquo;t believe
that there are over 250 inches of supple,
highly tempered springs between the saddle and
the road. It&rsquo;s as elastic and flexible as a bamboo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
cane. Each spring has double scrolls that come
into action one after another whenever you have a
jolt. Then, too, there are rubber bumpers to take
the recoil. Why, it&rsquo;s like a parlor car on a limited
express. No fellow sitting back in a Pullman has
anything on me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a pampered son of luxury, all right,&rdquo;
mocked Tom. &ldquo;We children of toil take off our
hats to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert made a playful pass at him and went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;As to power, it would take the strength of
seven horses to match it. The engine has a piston
displacement of 61 inches. And yet you can control
that tremendous power so far as to slow down
to three miles an hour. Not that I often get down
to that, though. Fifty or sixty suit me better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to name it &lsquo;Pegasus,&rsquo; after the
flying horse,&rdquo; suggested Hinsdale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Old Pegasus would have his work cut out for
him if he tried to show me the way,&rdquo; smiled Bert.
&ldquo;Still I don&rsquo;t claim to beat anything that goes
through the air. But when you get down to solid
earth, I&rsquo;d back this daisy of mine to hold its own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old Red Scout might make you hustle
some,&rdquo; suggested Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; admitted Bert, &ldquo;she certainly was a hummer.
Do you remember the time she ran away
from the Gray Ghost? Speed was her middle
name that day.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It was, for fair,&rdquo; agreed Dick, &ldquo;but perhaps
she went still faster when we scudded up the track
that day, with the express thundering behind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our hearts went faster, anyway,&rdquo; declared
Tom. &ldquo;Gee, but that was a narrow squeak. It
makes me shiver now when I think of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; echoed Bert, little dreaming that
before long, on the splendid machine whose handlebars
he held, he would graze the very garments of
death.</p>

<p>Happily, however, the future was hidden, and
for the moment the little group were absorbed in
the mechanical wonders of the motorcycle that
loomed large in the road before them. It stood
for the last word in up-to-date construction. The
inventive genius of the twentieth century had spent
itself on every contrivance that would add to its
speed, strength and beauty. It was a poem in
bronze and steel and rubber. From the extremity
of the handlebars in front to the rim of its rear
wheel, not the tiniest thing had been overlooked or
left undone that could add to its perfection. Fork
and cams and springs and valves and carburetor&mdash;all
were of the finest material and the most careful
workmanship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seemed an awful lot to pay, when I heard
that it cost you over three hundred bucks,&rdquo; said
Tom, &ldquo;but after looking it over, I guess you got
your money&rsquo;s worth.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The value&rsquo;s there, all right,&rdquo; asserted Bert
confidently. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t take that amount of
money for the fun I&rsquo;ve had already. And what
I&rsquo;m going to have&rdquo;&mdash;he made a comprehensive
wave of the hand&mdash;&ldquo;it simply can&rsquo;t be reckoned in
cold coin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s getting to be a mighty popular way of
traveling,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;I saw it stated somewhere
that a quarter of a million are in use and that the
output is increasing all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Drake, &ldquo;they certainly cover a
wide field. Ministers, doctors, rural mail carriers,
gas, electric and telephone companies are using
them more and more. In the great pastures of the
West, the herders use them in making their rounds
and looking after the sheep. All the police departments
in the big cities employ a lot of them,
and in about every foreign army there is a motorcycle
corps. You&rsquo;ve surely got lots of company,
old man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and we&rsquo;re only the vanguard. The time
is coming when they&rsquo;ll be used as widely as the bicycle
in its palmiest days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A bicycle wouldn&rsquo;t have done you much good
the other day, in that wild ride down to the
switch,&rdquo; grinned Drake. &ldquo;By the way, Bert, the
press associations got hold of that, and now the
whole country&rsquo;s humming with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bert, anxious to change the subject,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
&ldquo;if she&rsquo;ll only do as well in the race from
coast to coast, I won&rsquo;t have any kick coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about that contest anyway?&rdquo; queried
Hinsdale. &ldquo;Have you really decided to go into
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; answered Bert. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why
I shouldn&rsquo;t. Commencement will be over by the
eighth, and the race doesn&rsquo;t start until the tenth.
That will give me plenty of time to get into shape.
As a matter of fact, I&rsquo;m almost fit now, and Reddy
is training me for two hours every afternoon. I&rsquo;ve
almost got down to my best weight already, and
I&rsquo;m going to take the rest off so slowly that I&rsquo;ll be
in the pink of condition when the race begins.
Reddy knows me like a book and he says he never
saw me in better form.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he went on thoughtfully, &ldquo;the
game is new to me and I&rsquo;m not at all sure of winning.
But I think I have a chance. I&rsquo;d like to win
for the honor of it and because I hate to lose. And
then, too, that purse of ten thousand dollars looks
awfully good to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The race to which the boys referred had been
for some time past a subject of eager interest, and
had provoked much discussion in sporting and college
circles. The idea had been developing since
the preceding winter from a chance remark as to
the time it would take a motorcycle to go from the
Atlantic to the Pacific. A guess had been hazarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
that it could be done in twenty days. This had
been disputed, and, as an outcome of the discussion,
a general race had been projected to settle the question.
The Good Roads Association of America,
in conjunction with a number of motorcycle manufacturers,
had offered a purse of five thousand dollars
for the competitor who made the journey in
the shortest time. If that time came within twenty
days, an additional two thousand dollars was to be
given to the winner.</p>

<p>One other element entered into the problem.
The San Francisco Exposition, designed to celebrate
the opening of the Panama Canal, would be
in full swing at the time the survivors of the race
reached the coast. One of the great features of
the Fair was to be an international carnival of
sports. There were to be contests in cavalry riding,
in fencing, in auto racing, and the pick of the
world were expected to compete. But of special
interest to Bert was the international motorcycle
race, which for the first time was to be held in
America. Two years before, it had taken place in
Paris and, a year later, in London. But this year
it was America&rsquo;s turn, and because of the immense
crowds expected at the Exposition, San Francisco
had been chosen as the city to stage the event.
There was to be a first prize of three thousand
dollars and lesser purses for those that came in
second and third. If, by any chance, the winner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of the long distance race should break the twenty
day limit and also win the final race at the Fair, his
total reward would amount to ten thousand dollars.</p>

<p>With such a possibility in prospect, it was not
surprising that Bert should be strongly tempted to
enter the race. He was a natural athlete, and in
his college course so far had stood head and shoulders
above his competitors. As pitcher on the
&rsquo;Varsity team, he had cinched the pennant by his
superb twirling in a most exciting series of diamond
battles. He had been chosen as a contender on the
American Olympic team, and had carried off the
Marathon after a heart-breaking race, in which
every ounce of speed and stamina had been tried
to the utmost. In an auto race between rival campers,
his hand at the wheel had guided the Red Scout
to victory over the Gray Ghost, its redoubtable
antagonist. He was a splendid physical machine
of brawn and sinew and nerve and muscle. Outdoor
life, vigorous exercise and clean living, combined
with his natural gifts, made him a competitor
to be feared and respected in any contest that he
chose to enter.</p>

<p>But his lithe, supple body was not his only, or
indeed, his chief asset. What made him preëminent
was his quick mind and indomitable will, of
which his body was only the servant. His courage
and audacity were superb. Again and again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
he had been confronted with accidents and discouragements
that would have caused a weaker fellow
to quit and blame the result on fate. He had won
the deciding game in the baseball race, after his
comrades had virtually thrown it away. In the
Marathon, it was with bruised and bleeding feet
that he overtook his antagonist at the very tape.
The harder bad luck tried to down him, the more
fiercely he rose in rebellion. And it was this bulldog
grip, this unshaken tenacity, this &ldquo;never know
when you are beaten&rdquo; spirit that put him in a class
by himself and made him the idol of his comrades.
They had seen him so often snatch victory from
the very jaws of defeat, that they were prepared
to back him to the limit. Win or lose, they knew
that he would do his best, and, if defeated, go
down fighting.</p>

<p>With such a character and record back of him,
his enthusiastic friends were inclined to think that
it was &ldquo;all over but the shouting.&rdquo; Bert, however,
had no such delusion. If it had been simply a matter
of muscle or swiftness or courage, he would
have felt more confident of the outcome. But here
the &ldquo;human equation&rdquo; was not the only thing involved.
The quality and strength of the machine
he rode would be a very prominent and perhaps a
deciding factor. He felt sure that he was in such
prime physical condition that he could endure the
gruelling grind. But would his machine be equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
to the task? The most dashing horseman would
have to halt, if his steed foundered beneath him.
The most daring aviator would have to descend to
earth, if his motor stopped. So Bert, no matter
how strong and plucky, must fail, if his machine
should go back on him.</p>

<p>For there could be no substitute. This was one
of the conditions of the race. He must finish, if at
all, on the same machine with which he started.
The contestants were permitted to make repairs to
any extent. Tires, forks, springs and any other
parts could be replaced, and, at intervals along the
route, supplies could be held in readiness, in addition
to those that the rider carried. But essentially
the identical machine must be used throughout the
race. In the event of a hopeless smashup, the luckless
rider was, of course, out for good. The racer
and the machine were thus indispensable to each
other. Neither could win if the other balked.
They were like the two blades of a shears&mdash;strong
when together but useless when separated.</p>

<p>To guard as much as possible against defects,
Bert had been especially careful in selecting his
motorcycle. He had the eye for a machine that a
gipsy has for a horse. Among a host of others,
he had chosen one that appealed to him as the
acme of what a motorcycle should be. It was a
seven horse power, twin cylinder racer, with every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
appliance and improvement known at the time it
left the factory.</p>

<p>The brakes, for instance, were more powerful
than those fitted to any previous type. It could be
operated by a foot lever on the right side of the
machine and also by a grip lever in the left handlebar.
The double action was caused by the expansion
and contraction of two bands inside and outside
a brake drum.</p>

<p>Then, too, there was a foot-starting device that
was a marvel of simplicity. A single downward
pressure of the foot, and the racer started off at
once.</p>

<p>An improved rear hub also aroused Bert&rsquo;s enthusiasm,
because of its extra large size and the
fact that it ran on ball bearings that were absolutely
frictionless. In both the front and rear
hubs there was a knock-out axle, so that the wheels
could be removed without interfering with the adjustment
of the bearings.</p>

<p>In fact, the more Bert studied what had become
his most precious possession the more convinced
he grew that he had secured a &ldquo;gem of the first
water.&rdquo; And now that the first stiffness had worn
off, the machine was &ldquo;running like a watch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ignition was perfect, the transmission left
nothing to be desired, and the most critical inspection
could find no fault with any detail of the steel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
charger that was to carry him and his fortunes to
victory or defeat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to christen it, Bert?&rdquo;
asked Tom. &ldquo;Cut out the Pegasus stuff and tell
it to us straight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the level, I think I&rsquo;ll call it the &lsquo;Blue
Streak,&rsquo;&rdquo; answered Bert. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way it covers
the ground, as a rule, and I hope it will be prophetic.
Besides, blue is our college color and it
ought to bring me luck. That&rsquo;s the color I wore
when we took the Grays and Maroons into camp,
and I had it at my belt when I collared Dorner in
the Stadium. Everything goes in threes, you know,
and this will be the third time I&rsquo;m out to win since
I was a Freshie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bully for you, old top,&rdquo; exclaimed Drake, with
a rousing thump on the shoulder. &ldquo;The fellows
will be tickled to death to know that the good old
blue is showing the way across country. And when
we hear that you&rsquo;ve come in first, there&rsquo;ll be a yell
that you&rsquo;ll hear way off in Frisco.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t count your chickens too soon, my boy,&rdquo;
cautioned Bert; but his heart was warmed and
elated by the confidence his comrades had in him,
and he vowed to himself that he would justify it,
if it were humanly possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To judge from the names already entered, it&rsquo;s
going to be a weird color scheme,&rdquo; laughed Dick.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the Yellow Dragon and the Red Devil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and the Brown Antelope and the White Cloud and
the Black Knight; and there&rsquo;ll probably be others
before the list is full.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee,&rdquo; chortled Tom, &ldquo;if a hobo should see
them coming all at once, he&rsquo;d think that he had
them again, sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Bert, &ldquo;it would certainly be a
crazy quilt effect, if they should all come along
together. But there are so many different routes
that, ten to one, we won&rsquo;t catch sight of each other
after the bunch scatters at the start.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about the route?&rdquo; asked Martin. &ldquo;I
should think that would be one of the most important
things to take into account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So it would, if it were left to me. But it isn&rsquo;t.
You see, one of the great objects of the Good
Roads Association is to plan a great national highway
from coast to coast. They want to get all the
facts about every possible route, so that they&rsquo;ll
have something to go on, when they put it up to the
different States to get legislation on their pet
hobby. This race they think will be of great importance
for this purpose, because it won&rsquo;t be based
on theory but on actual experience. So they have
mapped out a large number of possible lines to be
followed&mdash;northern, central and southern,&mdash;and
when they&rsquo;ve got them all marked out, lots will be
drawn and the fellows will have to follow the
route that chance gives them. Of course, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
can&rsquo;t be exactly alike in the matter of distance. But
it will be as fair for one as the other, and, all
things considered, they&rsquo;ll average up about alike.
I expect to get a letter any day now, giving the
special trip that luck has picked out for me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;it isn&rsquo;t all absolutely
cut and dried. They don&rsquo;t mark out every highway
and byway that you must travel, on pain of
being disqualified. But you&rsquo;re given a chain of important
towns and great centers that you must hit
one after the other on your trip across the continent.
As long as you do that, you are left to your
own judgment as to the best and quickest way of
getting there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about any crooked work?&rdquo; put in Axtell.
&ldquo;Is there any chance of that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not worrying much about that,&rdquo; answered
Bert. &ldquo;To be sure, where so much is at stake,
there&rsquo;s always a chance of some one trying to turn
a trick. But I don&rsquo;t see where they could &lsquo;put it
over.&rsquo; At every important place there&rsquo;ll be timers
and checkers to keep tally on the riders. The machines
are all registered and numbered and so carefully
described that, in case of a smashup, a fellow
couldn&rsquo;t slip in another one without being found
out at the next stopping place. Then, too, if they
tried to get a lift on a train, there would have to be
too many in the secret. Besides, in all the names
I&rsquo;ve seen so far of the racers, there&rsquo;s only one that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
might possibly stoop to anything of that kind. His
name is Hayward, and from what I&rsquo;ve heard he&rsquo;s
been mixed up with one or two shady deals. There
have only been whispers and suspicions, however,
and they&rsquo;ve never been able actually to prove anything
against him. So he is still nominally in good
standing and eligible to ride. It may be all conjecture
anyway. He probably wouldn&rsquo;t cheat if he
could, and couldn&rsquo;t if he would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;it certainly seems as though
the best man and the best machine ought to win.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand that the race is to start from New
York,&rdquo; remarked Drake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Bert, preparing to mount the
machine, &ldquo;from one of the beaches near the city.
It&rsquo;s to be actually from ocean to ocean. The rear
wheel is to be wet in the Atlantic. Then the fight
is on in earnest and only ends when the front wheel
is dipped in the Pacific.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twill be some race,&rdquo; remarked Martin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to travel like the wind,&rdquo; warned
Hinsdale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; laughed Bert, as he threw in the clutch,
&ldquo;to make it in twenty days, I&rsquo;ll have to go like a
blue streak.&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">From Coast to Coast</span></h3>


<p class="cap">The next few days flew by with magical swiftness.
There were a thousand things to be
done, and Bert found himself wishing that each day
had a hundred hours instead of twenty-four. The
term examinations were on, and he buckled down
to them manfully. He had never neglected his
class work in favor of athletic sports and his standing
had always been high. He worked as hard
as he played, and in both study and games was up
in the front rank.</p>

<p>But when these ordeals were over and he had
passed triumphantly, every spare moment was devoted
to the coming race. He put into his preparation
all his heart and soul. And in this, he was
ably aided and abetted by Reddy, the college
trainer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reddy,&rdquo; as he was called from the flaming
mop of hair that adorned his far from classic brow,
was a character. For many years he had been in
complete control of the football, baseball and general
track teams of the college. He had formerly
been a crack second baseman in a major league,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
but an injured ankle had forced his withdrawal
from the active playing ranks. He had a shrewd,
though uneducated, mind, and his knowledge of
sports and ability as a trainer had made him famous
in the athletic world. His dry wit and genial
disposition made him a great favorite with the
boys, though he ruled with an iron hand when
discipline was needed.</p>

<p>He was especially proud and fond of Bert for
two reasons. In the first place, his trainers&rsquo; soul
rejoiced in having such a superb physical specimen
to develop into a winner. He had so often been
called upon to &ldquo;make bricks without straw,&rdquo; that
he exulted in this splendid material ready to his
hand. And when his faith had been justified by
the great victories that Bert had won, Reddy felt
that it was, in part, his own personal triumph.</p>

<p>Then, too, Bert had never shirked or broken
training. His sense of honor was high and fine,
and he kept as rigidly to his work in the trainer&rsquo;s
absence as in his presence. Reddy had never had
to put detectives on his track or search him out in
the poolrooms and saloons of the town. He was
true to himself, true to his team, true to his college,
and could always be counted on to be in first-class
condition.</p>

<p>So that, although this was not a college event,
Reddy took a keen personal interest in the coming
contest. Every afternoon, he held the watch while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Bert circled the track, and he personally superintended
the bath and rubdown, after the test was
over. He knew the exact weight at which his
charge was most effective, and he took off the superfluous
flesh just fast enough not to weaken him.
And his Irish blue eyes twinkled with satisfaction,
as he noted that just now he had never seen him in
better shape for the task that lay before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; he said, with an air of finality, two
days before the race, as he snapped his split-second
chronometer, after a whirlwind sprint. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not
tell ye jist the time ye made for that last five miles,
as I don&rsquo;t want ye to get the swelled head. But,
my word for it, ye&rsquo;re on edge, and I don&rsquo;t want ye
to touch that machine again until ye face the
starter. Ye&rsquo;re down fine enough and I don&rsquo;t want
ye to go stale before the race begins. I&rsquo;ve left jist
enough beef on ye to give ye a wee bit of a margin
to work off. The rest is solid bone and muscle,
and, if the machine is as good as yerself, ye&rsquo;ll get
to the coast first with something to spare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bert warmly, &ldquo;it will be your victory
as well as mine if I do. You&rsquo;re my &lsquo;one best
bet&rsquo; when it comes to getting into form. I wouldn&rsquo;t
have had half a chance to pull off any of the stunts
I have, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Reddy tossed this lightly aside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; he protested, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis yersilf has
done the work, and yersilf should get the credit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
And ye&rsquo;ve done it too in the face of accident and
hard luck. This time I&rsquo;m hoping that luck will
be on yer side. And to make sure,&rdquo; he grinned,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to give yer a sprig of four-leaved shamrock
that came to me from the folks at home, last
seventeenth of March. &rsquo;Twill not be hurting ye
any to have it along with yer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; laughed Bert. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll slip it in the
tool box and carry it every foot of the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And as Reddy had groomed Bert, so Bert
groomed his machine. Every nut and bolt, valve
and spring was gone over again and again, until
even his critical judgment was satisfied. It was to
carry not only his fortune but perhaps his life, and
he did not rest until he was convinced that nothing
could add to its perfection. It had become almost
a part of himself, and it was with a feeling of reluctance
that at last he had it carefully crated and
sent on to the starting point, to await his coming
forty-eight hours later.</p>

<p>That evening, as he returned from the post office,
he met Tom and Dick at the foot of the steps
leading to their dormitory. He waved at them an
open letter that he had been reading.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s from the Committee,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;It
gives the route and final instructions. Come up to
the rooms and we&rsquo;ll go over it together.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A bond of friendship, far from common, united
these three comrades&mdash;the &ldquo;Three Guardsmen,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
as they were jokingly called, because they were so
constantly together. They had first met at a summer
camp, some years before, and a strong similarity
of character and tastes had drawn them to
each other at once. From that time on, it had
been &ldquo;one for three and three for one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Full to the brim as they were of high spirits and
love of adventure, they often got into scrapes from
which it required all their nerve and ingenuity to
emerge with a whole skin. Their supreme confidence
in themselves often led them to take chances
from which older and wiser heads would have
shrunk. And the various exploits in which they
had indulged had taught each how fully and absolutely
he might rely on the others. On more
than one occasion, death itself had been among the
possibilities, but even that supreme test had been
met without flinching.</p>

<p>Only a few months before, when, on their journey
through Mexico, Dick had fallen into the
hands of El Tigre, the dreaded leader of guerillas,
Bert and Tom had taken the trail at once, and after
a most exciting chase, had rescued him from the
bandit&rsquo;s clutches. During a trip to the Adirondacks,
Tom had been bitten by a rattler and would
have perished, had it not been for Bert&rsquo;s quickness
of mind and swiftness of foot. And Bert himself
never expected to come closer to death than that
day on the San Francisco wharf, when Dick had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
grasped the knife hand of the Malay running
amuck, just as it was upraised to strike.</p>

<p>Any man or any danger that threatened one
would have to count on tackling three. Each knew
that in a pinch the others would stick at nothing
in the effort to back him up. And this conviction,
growing stronger with every new experience, had
cemented their friendship beyond all possibility of
breaking.</p>

<p>Their early ties had ripened and broadened under
the influence of their college life. Dick had
entered a year before the other two, and it was this
that had moved them to choose the same Alma
Mater. Dick and Tom were studying to be civil
engineers, while Bert was more strongly drawn
toward the field of electricity and wireless telegraphy.
Their keen intelligence had won them high
honors in scholarship, and their brawn and muscle
had achieved an enviable distinction in athletics.
On the pennant winning team of the year before,
Bert&rsquo;s brilliant pitching had been ably supported
by the star work of Tom at third, while Dick, beside
being the champion slugger of the team, had
held down first base like a veteran. All were immensely
popular with the student body in general,
not only for their prowess, but because of the qualities
of mind and heart that would have singled
them out anywhere as splendid specimens of young
American manhood.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Bert and Dick roomed together, while Tom&rsquo;s
quarters were on the floor below. Now, as it was
nearer, they all piled into Tom&rsquo;s sitting-room,
eager to discuss the contents of the official letter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; said Bert, as he tossed it over to
the others. &ldquo;You see, I have the southern route.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, thunder,&rdquo; groaned Tom, &ldquo;the toughest of
the lot. You&rsquo;ll fairly melt down there at this time
of year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> rough,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;The roads there are
something fierce. The northern or central route
would have been ten times better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; agreed Bert, &ldquo;it certainly is a handicap.
If I&rsquo;d been left to choose, myself, I wouldn&rsquo;t have
dreamed of going that way. Still, it&rsquo;s all a matter
of lot, and I&rsquo;ve got no kick coming. Somebody
would have had to draw it, and I might as well be
the victim as any one else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Spoken like a sport, all right,&rdquo; grumbled Tom.
&ldquo;But it makes me sore at fate. You&rsquo;ll need something
more than Reddy&rsquo;s shamrock to make up
for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might hunt me up the hind foot of a rabbit,
shot by a cross-eyed coon in a graveyard, in the
&lsquo;dark of the moon,&rsquo; if you want to make sure of
my winning,&rdquo; jested Bert. &ldquo;But, seriously, fellows,
I&rsquo;m not going to let that rattle me a little bit.
It may be harder, but if I do come in first, there&rsquo;ll
be all the more credit in winning. As for the heat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
I&rsquo;ll make my own breeze as I go along, and I&rsquo;ll
take my chances on the roads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose there&rsquo;s no use growling,&rdquo; admitted
Tom, grudgingly. &ldquo;At any rate, we&rsquo;ll see
a section of the country we&rsquo;ve never seen before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>We</i>,&rdquo; cried Bert. &ldquo;What do you mean by
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just what I say,&rdquo; answered Tom, looking a
little guiltily at Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; yelled Bert, leaping to his feet. &ldquo;Are
you two rascals going along?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surest thing you know,&rdquo; said Dick, calmly.
&ldquo;Did you think for a minute that Tom and I would
miss the fun of seeing you scoot across the continent
and win that ten thousand dollars? Not on
your life. We were going to surprise you, but
since this dub has let the cat out of the bag, we
might as well own up. There&rsquo;s nothing to do,
now that we know the route but to go out and get
the tickets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re a pair of bricks,&rdquo; gasped Bert.
&ldquo;The finest pals a fellow ever had. That&rsquo;s the
best news I&rsquo;ve had &lsquo;since Hector was a pup.&rsquo; I
didn&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;d see a friend&rsquo;s face from the
start to the finish. Talk about shamrocks and rabbit&rsquo;s
feet! This news has got them skinned to
death. It won&rsquo;t be any trick at all to toss off a few
hundred miles, if I can figure on seeing you fellows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
when I turn in for the night. Say, fellows, I can&rsquo;t
put it into words, but you know how I feel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pure selfishness on our part,&rdquo; said Dick, airily,
to mask his own deep feeling. &ldquo;We want to see
the San Francisco Fair, and figured that we&rsquo;d
never have a better chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; mocked Bert, delightedly, &ldquo;I size up that
selfishness all right. But now let&rsquo;s study the route
and figure out the schedule. Then you gay deceivers
can get through tickets with stopover privileges,
and I&rsquo;ll know just where to find you along
the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; explained Tom, &ldquo;we figured that we
could get into the big towns ahead of you and act
as a sort of base of supplies. You can keep tab on
the way the &lsquo;Blue Streak&rsquo; is running, and if anything
goes wrong&mdash;if a tire bursts or a fork breaks
or you have engine trouble&mdash;you can wire ahead
and we&rsquo;ll have everything ready for you to make a
lightning change the minute you heave in sight.
Of course, you may have to do some temporary
patching and tinkering along the way, but in really
big things we may come in handy. But now let&rsquo;s
cut out the hallelujahs and get down to brass
tacks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Which they did to such good effect that before
they turned in for the night, they had outlined a
plan that covered every probable contingency. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
course there was no such precision possible as in
the case of a railroad schedule. A hundred things
might happen to cause a change here, a delay there,
but, between certain elastic limits, the route and
time were carefully worked out. If they should
have to revise it, as they doubtless would, the telegraph
and long distance telephone could be depended
on to help them out.</p>

<p>Starting from New York, Bert figured that the
first leg of the journey would take him as far as
Philadelphia. This, of course, would not be typical
of the regular distance he would have to cover
each day, in order to beat the time record. But
the race was not to start until noon, so that a half
day was all that would be left the riders. And
that half day would be slower than the average,
because they would have to thread the streets of the
greater city with all its hindrances and speed regulations,
and would have bridges and ferries to cross
before they could fairly let themselves out. Of
course this would not count for a day in the timing,
as they would be allowed a half day at the end of
the journey to make up for it. In other words, the
day ran from noon to noon, instead of from midnight
to midnight.</p>

<p>From Philadelphia the route would lead to
Baltimore and Washington. Then he proposed to
strike down through West Virginia and into the
famous Blue Grass region of Kentucky and thence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
swing down toward Little Rock, Arkansas, which
would mark the extreme southern point of the
journey. After that, he would be going almost
directly west, with a slight trend to the north. He
would cut through Oklahoma on a direct horizontal,
and then for a short time traverse the upper
part of Texas. Leaving the Lone Star State, he
would strike in succession Santa Fé, New Mexico,
and Flagstaff, Arizona. Then, at last, he would
be in California, getting a glimpse of the sea at
Santa Barbara, and then sweeping up the valley to
San Francisco.</p>

<p>The record he had to beat was twenty days. He
planned to do it in fifteen. That is, he was confident
that as far as mere time were concerned, he
could reel off enough miles every day to take him
over the route within that limit. But that was
assuming that everything went smoothly, and, in a
trip of this length, he knew that such an assumption
was absurd. He gave himself three days for accidents
and delays. This, added to the fifteen of actual
running time, would still give him a comfortable
margin of forty-eight hours. But, on the
average, despite accident or breakdown, wind or
rain, sickness or health, mistaken roads or dangerous
spills, flood or freshet or tempest, he must
make from two to three hundred miles every day.
Not only he must be in shape to do it, but the &ldquo;Blue
Streak&rdquo; also. There were two machines that had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
take all the chances of wear and tear and mishap&mdash;the
physical machine above the saddle, and the
steel and rubber machine below it.</p>

<p>He wanted to make the most of the good roads
that he would have at the very beginning of the
trip. The first three days would be the best ones,
as far as this feature was concerned. The Eastern
and Northern States were far ahead of the rest of
the country in this respect. Their wealth and population,
as well as the vastly greater number of
motor vehicles in use, had early turned their attention
to the value and necessity of the best kind of
roads that money could buy and science invent.
After he left Louisville, the going would be harder.
While, at places, there would be magnificent turnpikes
along the main arteries of travel, these would
be more than counterbalanced by roads where clay
and sand predominated. But, to make up for this,
would be the fact that for long distances the roads
would be clearer and the speed regulations less
stringent. And, on these stretches, Bert promised
himself to &ldquo;hit it up&rdquo; hard enough to compensate
for the inferior quality of the road. It was &ldquo;all
in the game,&rdquo; and, in the long run, things would
about even up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good deal of a lottery, when all is said
and done,&rdquo; was the way he summed it up, as they
rose from the maps and papers spread out before
them; &ldquo;I may get knocked out on the first day, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
then again I may turn up smiling at the finish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; assented Tom, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no telling
what may happen before the race is over. But I
have a hunch that in this lottery you are going to
draw the capital prize.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; laughed Bert, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re as good a
prophet as you are a pal, I&rsquo;d be sure of it.&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Flying Start</span></h3>


<p class="cap">The day of the race dawned bright and clear.
There was just enough breeze to temper the
heat of the sun, but not enough to interfere with
the riders. There had been no rain since three days
before, and the roads, while a little dusty, were
firm and fast. Everything bespoke ideal conditions
for the event that, it was hoped, would hang up
new records in one of the most modern of sports.</p>

<p>The three friends had left college the day before,
and had taken up their quarters at one of the
hotels near the beach. They were full of health
and hope and enthusiasm. The work of the college
year was over, and they felt like colts kicking
up their heels in a pasture. Dick and Tom were
looking forward to the trip across the continent
and the wonders of the great Exposition. This
of itself would have been enough to account for
their exuberance, but there was the added excitement
of watching the progress of the great race,
and, in a sense, taking part in it. And, with all the
optimism of youth, they did not let themselves
feel the shadow of a doubt that their comrade
would come in triumphant.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>And Bert, although somewhat sobered by the
weight of responsibility that rested upon him, was
almost as jubilant as they. He was a born fighter,
and his spirits always rose on the eve of a contest.
He was &ldquo;tuned to the hour.&rdquo; The muscles of his
arms and legs glided like snakes beneath the white
skin, his color was good, his eyes shone, and he had
never in all his many contests felt in better physical
trim.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, he had hurried to the
garage to which the &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo; had been consigned,
and was delighted to find that it had made
the journey without a scratch. No one but himself
was permitted to give it the final grooming. He
personally filled the tank, looked to the oil, and
went over every nut and bolt and valve. Then he
sprang into the saddle and took a five-mile spin
around the neighboring race track. And even his
exacting criticism could find no shadow of defect.
The &ldquo;Blue Streak,&rdquo; like its master, was in perfect
condition.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, old boy,&rdquo; said Bert, as he patted the
beautiful machine, after the test, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to
be pretty close companions for the next few weeks,
and you&rsquo;ve got a big job cut out for you. But I
believe you&rsquo;re game for it, and if your rider is as
good as you are, I won&rsquo;t have anything left to
ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the hour drew near, a great crowd assembled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
to see the start. The contest had stirred up a vast
amount of interest among motor enthusiasts, and
many of the motorcycle clubs were represented by
big delegations. One or two of the entries had
dropped out at the last moment, and there were
ten contestants who faced the starter. Each had
his coterie of friends and well wishers who had
gathered to give him a rousing send off. But none
were greeted so uproariously as Bert, who had a
reception that &ldquo;warmed the cockles of his heart.&rdquo;
Undergraduates of the old college flocked around
him, and these were reinforced by hundreds of
alumni, living in or near the city, who scented one
more victory for the blue colors that they loved so
dearly. They swarmed about him, grasped his
hand and thumped him on the back, until if he had
been in poorer condition, he would have been black
and blue. It was with difficulty that he could tear
himself away from the multitude whose enthusiasm
outran their discretion. But many a day thereafter,
in loneliness and peril and the shadow of
death, the memory of that boisterous farewell was
an inspiration. The last hands he clasped were
those of Tom and Dick and Reddy, whose face was
as red as his hair from excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good luck, me bye,&rdquo; he called. Then in a
whisper, &ldquo;Ye haven&rsquo;t forgot the shamrock?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You bet I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; laughed Bert, and lifting
the cover of his tool box, he showed it lying on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
top. Whereat, Reddy heaved a sigh of relief, and
fell back satisfied.</p>

<p>And now everything was ready for the start.
The wheels had been dipped in the Atlantic, whose
surf curled up to meet them, as though to whisper
a message to its sister ocean. Then all the riders,
standing by their machines, were drawn up in line
on the boulevard that came down almost to the
beach. The conditions of the race were read aloud
and all of the racers with uplifted hand swore to
observe them. A letter from the Mayor of New
York to the Mayor of San Francisco was delivered
to each contestant. Only the one who reached
there first was to deliver his. The others would be
of value as souvenirs of perhaps a gallant but unsuccessful
struggle.</p>

<p>Then there was a moment&rsquo;s silence, while the
excitement grew tense. The starter lifted his pistol
and glanced along the waiting line. There
came a flash, a sharp report, and before the echoes
died away the riders were in the saddle. A tremendous
roar from the exhausts made the crowd shrink
back, and it scattered as the great machines leaped
forward. It was like the bursting of a rainbow.
Blue and red and black and white darted forward
in flying streaks of color, spreading out like the
sticks of a gigantic fan. Before the startled spectators
could catch their breath, the racers were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
vanishing from sight up the boulevard. The dash
from coast to coast had begun.</p>

<p>For the five mile ride along the parkway there
was no need of observing the speed regulations.
The road had been kept clear of all other vehicles,
and policemen placed along the route kept the
crowds to the paths on either side. The &ldquo;motor
cops,&rdquo; who were personally interested in that race,
that involved their own pet machine, waved greetings
as they passed.</p>

<p>In a few minutes they had left this atmosphere
of friendliness and enthusiasm, and were getting
into the stream of the city&rsquo;s traffic. From now on,
there was need of constant vigilance. The riders
began to separate, each steering through the street
that they figured would bring them most quickly
and easily to the bridges that spanned the river.
By the time Bert had crossed the old Brooklyn
Bridge, he had lost sight of all his competitors.
By different roads, from now on, they would fly
toward the common goal, so many thousand miles
distant. The spectacular features were in the past.
Now each one, alone and unaided, was to &ldquo;work
out his own salvation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there was no sinking of the heart, as Bert,
after crossing the bridge and winding through the
packed streets of lower New York, stood on the
ferry boat and watched the irregular sky line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the great city. What would happen to him before
he saw it again, it was fortunate that he could not
guess. But just now, his heart beat high with the
delight of struggle and achievement. He had his
chance. And he was determined to make that
chance a certainty.</p>

<p>He was the first one off the boat when it swung
into its slip, and as soon as he got beyond the business
quarter of Jersey City, he began to &ldquo;eat up&rdquo;
the space across the meadows. He was flying when
he reached Newark, where he again had to let up
in his pace for a few minutes. But luck was with
him and gave him an unexpected pace maker, just
as he drew into the open spaces beyond the city
limits.</p>

<p>The broad road ran right alongside the railroad
track, and just as Bert let out a link and got into
his stride, a limited express came thundering along
at a high rate of speed. The racing instinct woke
in Bert and he let his machine out until it was traveling
like the wind. For a mile or two they went
along like a team, neither seeming able to lose the
other.</p>

<p>The passengers, gazing listlessly out of the windows,
gradually woke up to the fact that this tiny
machine was actually racing with their train. At
first they were amused at the seeming impudence,
but as mile after mile passed, with the &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo;
holding its own, they became excited. The sportsman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
spirit that seems characteristic of America was
aroused, and all the windows on that side of the
train were filled with crowding faces. It was like
a pygmy daring a giant, a tugboat challenging the
<i>Imperator</i>.</p>

<p>The engineer, at first looking languidly at the
impertinent racer, made no special effort to increase
his speed. But when Bert hung to his flank and
refused to be shaken off, he turned and said something
to his fireman. The latter shoveled desperately,
the engineer let out his throttle, and the
great train lunged forward.</p>

<p>But Bert, too, had something &ldquo;up his sleeve.&rdquo;
He had been keeping well within his limit, and he
knew the speed of which his gallant mount was
capable. A mile ahead he could see where the
road crossed the track. With a quick twist of the
wrist, he threw in the highest speed and had to
grip his handlebars hard to keep his seat as his iron
steed responded. He flashed on ahead, fairly
scorching up the road, and dashed across the track
fifty feet ahead of the onrushing locomotive.
Then, as the passengers rushed over to the other
side of the cars, he waved his cap to them, shook it
defiantly at the discomfited engineer and fireman,
and disappeared around the bend of the road.
Then he gradually slackened his pace, though still
maintaining a high rate of speed.</p>

<p>Bert was hilarious. It was his first race, so far,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and he had come out ahead. He took it as an
omen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some race, old scout,&rdquo; he confided joyously to
his mount. &ldquo;You certainly lived up to your name
that time.&rdquo; And he laughed aloud, as he remembered
the look on the faces in the cab.</p>

<p>The race had been a capital thing, not only for
the many miles he had covered, but because of the
added confidence that had been infused into his
veins by the successful outcome. He had &ldquo;ridden
rings&rdquo; around his redoubtable opponent, and his
heart was full of elation.</p>

<p>As he neared Trenton, he stopped at a garage to
replenish his gasoline. He had plenty left to finish
out the stretch that he had mapped out for that
day&rsquo;s work, but he was taking no chances, and always
felt better when he knew that his tank was
full.</p>

<p>A tall young fellow had preceded him on the
same errand, and was just about to mount his wheel
when Bert entered. There was something familiar
about him and Bert cudgeled his brains to remember
where he had met him. The stranger seemed
equally puzzled. Then a sudden gleam of memory
lighted up his face, and he came toward Bert with
outstretched hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t your name
Wilson&mdash;Bert Wilson, the college pitcher?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Bert, taking the hand held out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to him, &ldquo;and you&mdash;sure I know,&rdquo; he exclaimed, as
recognition flashed upon him&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;re Gunther of
the Maroons. I couldn&rsquo;t place you for a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You placed me all right in that last game, when
you struck me out in the ninth inning,&rdquo; grinned
Gunther. &ldquo;Do you remember?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Did Bert remember? Could he ever forget?
Again the scene came before him as though it were
yesterday. He saw the diamond gleaming in the
afternoon sun, the stands packed with twenty-five
thousand howling maniacs. It was the final game
of the season, and the pennant hung upon the outcome.
Two men were out when Gunther came to
the bat. He was the heaviest slugger of the
league, and the home crowd was begging him to
&ldquo;kill the ball.&rdquo; Bert had outguessed him on the
first strike, and snapped one over by surprise on
the second. Then, on the third, he had cut loose
that mighty &ldquo;fadeaway&rdquo; of his. For forty feet
it had gone on a line&mdash;hesitated&mdash;swerved sharply
down and in, and, evading Gunther&rsquo;s despairing
swing, plumped into the catcher&rsquo;s mitt. And the
howl that went up&mdash;and the mighty swoop of the
fellows on the field&mdash;and the wild enthusiasm over
Bert&mdash;and the bonfires&mdash;and the snake dances!
Did he remember?</p>

<p>&ldquo;You certainly had me buffaloed that day, all
right,&rdquo; went on Gunther. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t often that I hit
a foot above a ball, but that fadeaway of yours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
had me going. I simply couldn&rsquo;t gauge it. It&rsquo;s a
teaser, for fair. You were the whole team that
day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had the luck, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; protested Bert.
&ldquo;The breaks of the game were with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t luck,&rdquo; said Gunther, generously; &ldquo;you
simply outplayed us. But we did make you work
to win,&rdquo; he added, with a reminiscent smile.</p>

<p>By this time, the tank had been replenished, and
he was recalled from his &ldquo;fanning bee&rdquo; by the
necessity of resuming his trip. Gunther had heard
of the contest and had seen Bert&rsquo;s name among the
competitors, but had not associated it with the
Wilson of baseball fame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get away from the game,&rdquo; he joked,
referring to the ten contestants. &ldquo;I see that you
are still playing against a &lsquo;nine.&rsquo; If that pun isn&rsquo;t
bad enough, I&rsquo;ll go you one better&mdash;or worse&mdash;and
bet that you&rsquo;ll bowl them over like ninepins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, old man,&rdquo; responded Bert. &ldquo;I hope
I&rsquo;ll make a &lsquo;strike.&rsquo; But now I&rsquo;ll have to skip and
cut out the merry jesting. Jump on your wheel
and set the pace for me for the next ten miles or
so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Swell chance of my making pace for that crackerjack
you have there,&rdquo; said Gunther, looking admiringly
at the &ldquo;Blue Streak,&rdquo; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll try to keep
alongside, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had a surprisingly good machine and
doubled Bert&rsquo;s dare by riding twenty miles or more,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
before he finally hauled up and, with a warm handgrip,
said goodby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two pleasant things to-day,&rdquo; mused Bert, as he
sped on, referring to the popular theory that
events, good or bad, come in threes. &ldquo;I guess the
third will be in meeting good old Tom and Dick,
when I swing into the City of Brotherly Love.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And pleasant it certainly was, when, after reporting
to the checkers and timers at the club headquarters,
and putting up his motorcycle, he turned
toward the hotel where his chums awaited him with
a royal welcome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve surely got off to a flying start, old top,&rdquo;
said Tom. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t any idea that you&rsquo;d hit this
burg so soon. We&rsquo;ve just fairly got in ourselves.
But before anything else, let&rsquo;s wrap ourselves about
some eats. Are you hungry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I hungry?&rdquo; echoed Bert. &ldquo;Is a wolf hungry?
Is a hawk hungry? Is a cormorant&mdash;say,
lead me to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And at the bountiful table to which they
straightway adjourned, Bert proved that none of
the natural history specimens he had mentioned
&ldquo;had anything on him.&rdquo; Nor did his friends lag
far behind, and it is doubtful if three happier and
fuller young fellows could have been found in
Philadelphia, as, afterward, they discussed the
events of the day. They were especially interested
in Bert&rsquo;s meeting with Gunther, as they themselves
had taken part in that famous game. Dick&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
mighty work with the stick on that occasion and
Tom&rsquo;s great steal home from third were matters
of baseball history.</p>

<p>Then Bert mentioned the railroad episode.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to have seen the way I beat a train,
fellows,&rdquo; he gloated. &ldquo;My, but it took some tall
speeding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beat a train?&rdquo; questioned Tom, incredulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it&mdash;a freight?&rdquo; bantered Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Freight nothing,&rdquo; retorted Bert, a little nettled.
&ldquo;A limited express, if you ask me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Near Newark, did you say?&rdquo; queried Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; was Bert&rsquo;s rejoinder, &ldquo;but as it
happened, it was just outside of Newark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beat a limited express,&rdquo; murmured Dick, shaking
his head. &ldquo;Tom, I&rsquo;m afraid Bert&rsquo;s stringing
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Imposing on our innocence, it seems to me,&rdquo;
assented Tom, gloomily. &ldquo;The next thing, he&rsquo;ll
be telling us that he made a daredevil dash across
the track in front of the locomotive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And waved his cap at the passengers,&rdquo;
mourned Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And shook it at the engineer,&rdquo; added Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; began Bert, &ldquo;what&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; But the sight
of his bewildered face was too much, and they
burst into a roar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You poor boob,&rdquo; sputtered Tom, as soon as he
could speak. &ldquo;We were on that train.&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Deserted Hut</span></h3>


<p class="cap">Bert&rsquo;s first thought, when he opened his eyes
the next morning, was of the weather. This
was destined to be the chief object of anxiety all
through the trip. As long as it kept reasonably
dry and clear, one big element of danger and delay
could be left out of his calculations. The lowering
of the sky meant the lowering of his hopes.</p>

<p>As he rushed to the window and drew aside the
curtain, he was relieved to see that the sun was rising.
To be sure, there was a slight haze around
it that might portend rain later on. But for the
present, at least, the roads were good. If rain
were on the way, all the more reason why he
should do some tall &ldquo;hustling&rdquo; while the going
was fair.</p>

<p>His sleep had been restful and refreshing, and
he hummed gaily to himself, as he rushed through
his ablutions. He stowed away a hasty but ample
breakfast, and then after a hearty farewell to his
chums, hurried around to the garage where his
machine was stored.</p>

<p>He was surprised to find a large gathering of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
motorcycle enthusiasts on hand. The news had
spread abroad that one of the contestants in the
great race had reached the city the night before,
and delegations from the many clubs had gathered
to give him a send-off and accompany him for a
few miles out of town. Bert greeted them warmly,
and, after assuring himself that the &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo;
was in first-class condition, leaped into the saddle
and started out at the head of the procession.</p>

<p>First one and then the other would make the
pace, sprinting for a short distance for all that he
was worth, and then dropping back into the ruck.
But Bert &ldquo;saw their bluff and went them one better,&rdquo;
and no matter how hard they &ldquo;hit it up,&rdquo; he
was always within striking distance of their rear
wheel. One by one they gave it up, and by the
time that thirty miles had been covered, Bert found
himself riding on alone. He had welcomed the
visitors, because of the goodwill that they had
shown and the pace that they had made. Their
company made the miles less long and furnished
him a mental tonic. Yet he was glad, when, with
nothing to distract him, he could bend all his energies
to the task before him and put the &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo;
to the top of its speed.</p>

<p>For he wanted to make this day a record breaker
in the matter of miles covered. The roads were
superb, and it behooved him to make the most of
them, with a view to having some surplus of time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
on hand, when he struck the slower stretches further
on.</p>

<p>There was plenty about him to enlist his
thoughts, had he allowed them to wander. He
was on historic ground, and every foot was rich
in Revolutionary memories. Here had Washington
with his ragged and barefooted and hungry
armies defied all the power of Great Britain. Mifflin
and Greene and Lafayette and &ldquo;Light Horse
Harry Lee&rdquo; had here done deeds of daring that
electrified the world. And, before night, he expected
to be on the scene of that greater and sadder
struggle, where Grant and Lee had flung their
giant armies at each other and drenched the soil
with fraternal blood. But, although Bert was an
ardent patriot, and, at any other time, nothing
would have more strongly appealed to him, now
he was utterly engrossed in the colossal task set
before him. This, in fact, was the one great
quality that had won him so many victories in the
athletic world&mdash;the ability of shutting out every
thing else for the time being, and concentrating all
his strength and attention on the task that lay at
hand.</p>

<p>Now, he was fairly flying. Mile after mile
swept away behind him, as he gave the &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo;
its head and let it show him what it could do. The
&ldquo;speed lust&rdquo; ran riot in his veins. As he neared
the different villages, on his route, he was forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
to slacken speed to some extent. It would never
do to be arrested for breaking the speed limit. He
foresaw all the heart-breaking delay, the officious
constable, the dilatory country justice of the peace,
the crowd of gaping rustics, the possible jail detention.
He was amply supplied with money to meet
any possible fine&mdash;but imprisonment was another
matter, that might be fraught with the direst consequences.
So, although he inwardly raged at the
necessity, he curbed his natural impulse, and slowed
up at crossings and country towns. But when
again he found himself out in the open, he amply
reimbursed himself for &ldquo;crawling,&rdquo; as he called it,
through the towns. It is doubtful whether the
startled townspeople would have called it &ldquo;crawling.&rdquo;
But everything in this world is comparative,
and where they would have thought themselves
flying at twenty miles an hour, Bert felt that he
was creeping at forty.</p>

<p>Few faster things had ever flashed like a streak
of light along the country roads. Horses, grazing
in the adjoining pastures, after one wild glance,
tossed up their heels and fled madly across the
fields. Even the cows, placidly chewing their cud,
were roused from their bovine calm and struggled
to their feet. Chickens, squawking wildly, ran
across the road, and although Bert tried his best
to avoid them, more than one paid the penalty for
miscalculating his speed. Dogs started fiercely in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
pursuit, and then disgustedly gave it up and crept
away with their tail between their legs. And all
the time the speedometer kept creeping rapidly up
and up, until, within two hours after the start, he
had wiped a hundred miles off his schedule.</p>

<p>Just once he had stopped in his mad flight, to get
a glass of milk at a farmhouse. He was in the
Pennsylvania Dutch district, the richest and thriftiest
farming country in the world. All about him
were opulent acres and waving fields of corn and
big red barns crammed to bursting. They were
worthy, sober people, rather prone to regard every
new invention as a snare of the Devil, and the farmer&rsquo;s
wife was inclined to look askance at the panting
machine that Bert bestrode. But his friendly,
genial face thawed her prejudice and reserve, and
she smilingly refused the money that he had offered
for the rich creamy milk she brought from
one of the shining pans in her dairy.</p>

<p>By ten o&rsquo;clock, he had passed through Baltimore,
and, before noon, he was riding over the
splendid roads of the nation&rsquo;s capitol. Here, despite
the temptation to spend an hour or two, he
only paused long enough to take a hearty meal
and check his time. He thrust aside the well-meant
invitations that were pressed upon him at the club,
and by two o&rsquo;clock had left Washington behind
him and was riding like a fiend toward West Virginia.
He wanted if possible to reach Charleston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
before night closed in. If he could do this, he
would be very well content to dismount and call
it a day&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>But now old Nature took a hand. All through
the morning, the haze had been thickening, and
now black clouds, big with threats of rain, were
climbing up the sky. The wind, too, was rising
and came soughing along in fitful gusts. Every
moment now was precious, and Bert bent low, as
he coaxed his machine to do its utmost.</p>

<p>And it responded beautifully. Like Sheridan&rsquo;s
horse on the road to Winchester, it seemed to feel
the mood of its rider. It was working like a
charm. Mile after mile sped away beneath the
wheels that passed light as a ghost over the broad
path beneath. Even when it had to tackle hills,
it never hesitated or faltered, but went up one
slope almost as fast as it went down another.</p>

<p>And the hills were growing more frequent. Up
to this time the roads had been almost as level as a
floor. But now, Bert was approaching the foothills
of the Blue Ridge, and not until he struck the lowlands
of Arkansas, would he be out of the shadow
of the mountains, which, while they added immensely
to the sublimity of the scenery, were no
friends to any one trying to make a record for
speed.</p>

<p>Still, this did not worry Bert. He expected to
get the &ldquo;lean&rdquo; as well as the &ldquo;fat.&rdquo; The North<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
American continent had not been framed to meet
his convenience, and he had to take it as it came.
All that especially bothered him was that threatening
sky and those frowning clouds that steadily
grew blacker.</p>

<p>His eyes and thoughts had been so steadily fixed
upon the heavens, that he had scarcely realized the
change in the surrounding country. But now he
woke up to the fact that his environment was entirely
different from that of the morning. Then
he had been in a rich farming country, the &ldquo;garden
of the Lord&rdquo;; now he was in the barren coal regions
of West Virginia. Beautiful mansions had
given place to tiny cabins; prosperous towns to
mountain hamlets. The farms were stony and
poorly cultivated. Great coal breakers stood out
against the landscape like gaunt skeletons. The
automobiles that had crowded the eastern roads
were here conspicuous by their absence. The faces
of those he passed on the road were pinched and
careworn. He was seeing life on one of its threadbare
levels.</p>

<p>But his musings on the inequalities of life were
rudely interrupted by a drop of rain that splashed
on his face. It was coming, then. But perhaps it
would only prove a shower. That would not deter
him. In fact he would welcome it, as it would
serve to lay the dust. But if it developed into a
steady downpour, he would have to seek shelter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
It would only be foolhardy to plough through the
mud with his tires skidding and threatening an
ugly fall that might mean a broken leg or arm.</p>

<p>Faster and faster the drops came down, and
faster and faster the &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo; scorched along
the road, as though to grasp every possible advantage,
before the elements had their way. Gradually
the roads lost their white, dusty appearance
and grew yellow in the waning light. Bert could
feel a perceptible slowing up as the mud began to
grip the wheel. Still he kept on, holding like a
miser to every precious mile that meant so much
to him.</p>

<p>Soon, however, he realized that &ldquo;the game was
up.&rdquo; The rain was coming down now in torrents,
and he was wet to the skin. And with the rain
came darkness so thick as &ldquo;almost to be felt.&rdquo;
Then a flash of lightning rent the sky, and a terrific
crash of thunder warned him that the storm
was on in earnest.</p>

<p>He looked about him for some place of shelter.
But there was nothing in sight, not even one of
the little cabins, of whose hospitality he would so
gladly have availed himself. The lightning came
so fast now that the sky was aflame with it, and
the thunder was continuous and deafening. He
did not dare to seek shelter under the trees, and,
in the open, the steel and iron of his motorcycle
might easily attract a lightning stroke.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>As he looked about him in perplexity, a peculiarly
blinding flash showed him a little shack at
the top of the hill he had been climbing when the
storm had broken. It was only a few rods ahead
of him, and, with a feeling of immense relief and
thankfulness, he made for it. There was no light
coming from it, and he did not know whether it
was inhabited or abandoned. But, in either case,
it was shelter from the fierceness of the storm, and
that was enough.</p>

<p>Leading the wheel from which he had dismounted,
he climbed the intervening space and
rapped at the door. He waited an instant and
then knocked again. Still there was no answer
and after pausing a moment, he pushed open the
door, that had no latch and yielded to his touch,
as he stepped inside.</p>

<p>At first, coming from the outer air, he could
only make out the outlines of the single room, of
which the cabin seemed to consist. He called out,
but there was no response. Then he rummaged
in his tool box, and got out a bit of candle that he
had provided for an emergency. From a waterproof
pouch in his khaki suit, he produced a match
and lighted the candle. Then, as the flickering
light grew into a steady flame, he was able to take
stock of his surroundings.</p>

<p>As he had surmised on his entrance, there was
only a single room. The floor was of dirt, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the shack had been simply slung together in the
rudest kind of a way. There was a small table of
unplaned boards and a stool, from which one of
the three legs was missing. A bunk in the corner
and a tattered blanket completed the entire outfit
of the temporary shelter in which Bert had so unexpectedly
found himself.</p>

<p>It might have been a cabin formerly dwelt in by
one of the &ldquo;poor whites&rdquo; of the mountains, or possibly
a hunter&rsquo;s shack that served at intervals for a
temporary camp. At all events, it was shelter,
and, in his present wet and desperate condition,
Bert was not inclined to &ldquo;look a gift horse in the
mouth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t exactly the Waldorf-Astoria,&rdquo; he
thought to himself, as he brought his motorcycle
in out of the pounding rain, &ldquo;but it surely looks
mighty good to me just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a rude fireplace at one side and some
wood and kindling left by the previous occupant,
and it was only a few moments before a cheery
blaze gave an air of comfort to the small interior.
After the fire was well started, Bert took his wet
garments one by one and dried them before the fire.
In a little while he was snug and dry, and inclined
to look philosophically on the day that had had
such an unlooked for ending. He even chuckled,
as he looked at the speedometer and found that it
registered over two hundred and fifty miles. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
at least was nearly up to his schedule, in spite of
the rain, and to-morrow was &ldquo;a new day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might easily have been worse,&rdquo; he thought.
&ldquo;Suppose it had rained that way this morning, instead
of holding off as long as it did. I&rsquo;ve cleared
the Eastern States, at any rate, and am at last
&lsquo;down South.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a precaution, when he stopped at Washington,
he had secured a few sandwiches and a can of
sardines. These he put out on the rough table,
and, as hunger is always &ldquo;the best sauce,&rdquo; he enjoyed
it hugely. There wasn&rsquo;t a crumb left, when
at last he leaned back contentedly and stretched his
legs before the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like Robinson Crusoe, I&rsquo;m master of all I
survey,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;Not that my kingdom is a
very extensive one,&rdquo; as he looked about the little
room, that he could have covered with one jump.</p>

<p>The rain still kept on with unabated fury, but
the harder it poured, the more cozy the shack
seemed by contrast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess you and I will have to bunk it out together,
old chap,&rdquo; he said, addressing his faithful
wheel. &ldquo;Well, I might easily find myself in worse
company. You&rsquo;re a good old pal, if there ever
was one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took from his kit some oiled rags and together
with some old gunny sacking that he found
in a corner, started to clean the machine. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
mud with which it was caked made this a work
of time, as well as a &ldquo;labor of love,&rdquo; and two
hours wore away before he had concluded. But
it was a thorough job, and, by the time he was
through, the &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo; was as bright and shining
as when it faced the starter at noon on the
day before.</p>

<p>While he was at work, Bert at times seemed
to hear something that sounded like the roar and
dash of waves. But he dismissed this as absurd.
It was probably the splashing of the water, as it
ran down the gullies at the side of the road. He
was far above the level of lake or pond, and there
was nothing on his map to indicate the presence of
any considerable body of water in that locality.
Once he went to the door, a little uneasily. But
in the pitch darkness, all he could see was the
lights of a little town, far down the valley. He
told himself that he was dreaming, and, after
promising himself an early start on the following
morning, he stretched himself out on the little bunk
in the corner, and in a few minutes had fallen into
a deep and refreshing sleep.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Broken Dam</span></h3>


<p class="cap">How long he slept he did not know, but,
while the cabin was still shrouded in darkness,
he woke suddenly and sat upright, as though
in response to a voice that called.</p>

<p>He looked about him, unable at first to realize
where he was. Then, as he reached out his hand,
it came in contact with the motorcycle, which he
had stood at the head of the bunk. His sleepy
brain cleared, and the events of the day before&mdash;the
storm&mdash;the deserted cabin&mdash;came back to him.
He struck a match and glanced at his watch. It
was a little after four, and, promising himself
that he would not go to sleep again, he blew out
the light and lay back in his bunk, planning out
the ride for the day so near at hand.</p>

<p>But try as he would, he could not concentrate
his mind on the subject in hand. Why had he
awakened so suddenly? It was wholly apart from
his ordinary habit. Usually he slept like a log,
and, like a healthy animal, came slowly out of
sleep. But this time it had been with a jump. He
told himself that it was probably due to his unusual
surroundings, and again tried to pin himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
down to his schedule. But a vague sense of uneasiness
would not vanish at his bidding. He felt
as though some monstrous danger was threatening.
Something direful and evil was in the air. In vain
he called himself an &ldquo;old woman,&rdquo; and laughed, a
little uncertainly, at his fears. The subtle threat
persisted.</p>

<p>He had never had a strong premonition of danger
that had not been justified. He was high
strung and sensitively organized, and warnings
that would leave unstirred a duller mind rang in
his consciousness like an alarm bell. He recalled
how, at Panama, not long ago, he had been impressed
by the same feeling of coming peril, when
the plot to destroy the canal was rapidly coming
to a head. It had been justified then. Why should
he not trust it now?</p>

<p>He hesitated no longer. He hastily threw aside
the old tattered blanket, hurried himself into his
clothes and went to the door of the cabin.</p>

<p>The rain had ceased, although the water was
still running in streams in the ditches that lined the
road. Darkness yet held sway, but, in the East,
he could see the gray fingers of the dawn. In the
dimness, he looked about him, and, as his eyes became
accustomed to the surroundings, he saw, at
a little distance, the outlines of a great structure
that lay level with the plateau on which the cabin
stood.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>With a few quick strides, he crossed the intervening
space until he stood on the brink of a gigantic
dam. Then he knew what was meant by
the splashing and gurgling he had heard the night
before.</p>

<p>Stretched out in front of him was an angry waste
of swirling waters. It was yellow and turbid from
the clay brought down by the mountain torrents
that acted as feeders to the lake. Great tree
trunks, tossed in the boiling waters, had been
jammed against the edge, increasing the pressure,
already great. Over the brink a cataract was falling,
that grew in volume with each passing moment.
Through crevices in the lower part of the
structure, other streams were trickling.</p>

<p>To Bert, as with whitening face he looked upon
the scene, it was evident that the dam was in danger
of collapse. There had been very heavy rains
in the preceding May, and the lake had been filled
to capacity. The storm of the night before had
probably developed into a cloudburst farther up
in the mountains, and the floods that came down
in consequence were putting it to a strain that had
not been counted upon when the dam was built.
It was none too strong originally&mdash;Bert could see
masses of rubble that had been inserted in the
structure in place of solid stone&mdash;and now the innocent
were in danger of paying a fearful price for
the carelessness or criminality of the builders.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>It had become much lighter now, and, as he
looked down at the valley below, he could dimly
make out the outlines of the houses in the town.
Human beings were sleeping there, serene and confident,
men, women and children, babes in their
mothers&rsquo; arms. And he alone knew of the terrible
monster that at this moment was threatening to
leap upon and destroy them.</p>

<p>He turned again to the dam. The crevices were
wider now. A perfect torrent was pouring over
the brink. Even while he looked, there was a
great bulge in the central part, and a deluge burst
through. Two of the capstones yielded and fell,
with a noise that was drowned by the still greater
roar of the unleashed waters. There was no longer
any doubt. The dam was giving way!</p>

<p>With a sickening fear at his heart, he turned and
raced for the cabin. A louder roar behind him
added wings to his feet. He burst open the door,
dragged out the &ldquo;Blue Streak,&rdquo; and in another moment
was in the saddle and riding for dear life
down the valley.</p>

<p>The mud was deep and at a curve of the road,
his rear tire skidded and threw him, bruised and
bleeding, a dozen feet in advance. But he felt
nothing, thought of nothing but the unconscious
sleepers who must be warned. Stumbling and
shaken, he resumed his seat, and tore along the
mountain road like the wind.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>At the scattered farmhouses along the way,
lights could be seen in the windows. Here and
there, he passed farmers already at work in the
fields. He blew his horn and yelled at these and
pointed behind him. They cast one startled glance
up the valley and then rushed to their houses.</p>

<p>He did not dare to look behind him, but he
could hear a sullen roar that momentarily grew
louder. He knew that the monster had broken
its bonds and was abroad seeking for prey. He
let out the last ounce of power that he possessed
as he raced on to the sleeping town. He had ridden
fast before, but never as he was riding now.</p>

<p>As he neared the town, he pulled wide open the
siren that he only used on extraordinary occasions.
It wailed out in a wild, weird shriek that spoke of
panic, danger, death. There was no mistaking the
meaning of that call.</p>

<p>Now he was in the outskirts, and frightened
faces appeared at the windows while half-dressed
men ran out of the doors. He waved his hand,
and shouted at the top of his lungs:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The dam has broken. Run for your lives!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The roar had now swelled into thunder. The
flood was coming with fearful velocity. No more
need of his siren. That hideous growl of the tumbling
waters carried its own warning.</p>

<p>The path on which Bert had been riding wound
along the side of the hill to the east of the town.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Corresponding slopes lay on the other side. The
dwellers on the sides of the hills were comparatively
safe. It was unlikely that the water would
reach them, or, at any rate, they could climb still
higher up and escape, even if their houses were
washed away. But there was no hope for the
buildings in the valley itself. They were right in
the path of the onrushing flood and would be swept
away like so many houses of cards. Nothing could
resist that pitiless torrent now less than a mile
away.</p>

<p>Bert leaped from his wheel and dragged it into
a thicket at the side of the path. He cast a swift
look up the valley. A great foaming wall of yellow
water, forty feet high, bearing on its crest
gigantic tree trunks and the debris of houses it had
picked up in its path, was bearing down on the
town with the swiftness of an avalanche.</p>

<p>The houses were emptying now and the streets
were full of frantic people, fleeing for their lives.
Bert heard the hoarse shouts of the men, the
screams of the women, the wailing of little children
roused suddenly from sleep. From every door
they poured forth, making desperate efforts to
reach the higher ground. The air resounded with
the shrieks of those driven almost mad by sudden
terror.</p>

<p>Into that pandemonium Bert plunged with the
energy of despair. The time was fearfully short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and the tumult of the coming flood was like the
thunder of Niagara. He met a mother with a
babe in her arms and two crying children holding
to her skirts. He grabbed the little ones up and
with a tousled little head under each arm placed
them in safety. A crippled boy, hobbling painfully
along on crutches, felt himself suddenly lifted from
the ground and hurried to the hillside. He was
here, there and everywhere, guiding, pointing, encouraging.
And then, just as he was stooping to
lift up a woman who had fainted, the flood was
upon him!</p>

<p>It struck the doomed town with the force of a
thunderbolt. Frame houses were picked up and
carried along like straws. Brick structures were
smashed into fragments. It was a weltering chaos
of horror and destruction.</p>

<p>When that mountainous mass of water crashed
down upon him, Bert for a moment lost consciousness.
It was like the impact of a gigantic hammer.
There was an interval of blackness, while the water
first beat him down and then lifted him up. He
had a horrible strangling sensation, and then, after
what seemed ages of agony, he found himself on
the surface, striking out blindly in that churning
mass of water that carried him along as though
in a mill race. He had never before realized the
tremendous power of water. He was a mere chip
tossed hither and thither upon the waves. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
head was dizzy from the awful shock of the first
impact, there was a ringing in his ears, and the
spray dashing into his eyes obscured his sight. Almost
mechanically, he moved his hands and feet
enough to keep his head above the surface. Gradually
his mind became clearer, and he could do
some connected thinking.</p>

<p>At any rate, he was alive. That was the main
thing. Although sore and bruised, he did not
think that any of his bones were broken. He was
an expert swimmer, and knew that if he kept his
senses he would not drown. His most imminent
danger lay in being struck by a tree trunk or
jammed between the houses that were grinding
each other to pieces. If this should happen, his life
would be snuffed out like a candle.</p>

<p>Even at that moment of frightful peril, one
thing filled his heart with gladness. He felt sure
that almost all the townspeople had escaped. Here
and there, he could see some one struggling like
himself in the yeasty surges, or clinging to some
floating object. Once the body of a man was carried
past within a few feet of him. His last conscious
glance before the flood overwhelmed him
had shown him a number who had not yet reached
the higher ground. These had been caught up with
him, and some no doubt had perished. But he
thanked God that hundreds, through his warning,
had found shelter on the hillsides. Their property<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
had been swept away, but they had retained
their most precious possession.</p>

<p>The loss in animal life was heavy. Bert groaned,
as he saw the bodies of cows and horses and dogs
tossed about in the raging waters. Not far off, a
horse was swimming and gallantly trying to keep
his head above water. His fear-distended eyes fell
on Bert, and he whinnied, as though asking for
help. But just then a great log was driven against
him, and with a scream that was almost human he
went under.</p>

<p>And now Bert noted that the force of the flood
was abating. It had reached the lowest part of the
valley, and, ahead of him, the ground began to
rise. With every foot of that ascent the torrent
would lose its impetus, until finally it would reach
its limit.</p>

<p>But there a new danger threatened. There
would be a tremendous backwash as the current receded,
and in the meeting of the two opposing
forces a terrific whirlpool would be generated, in
which nothing human could live. In some way he
must reach the shore before the flood turned back.</p>

<p>There was not an instant to lose, and he acted
with characteristic decision. The torrent was
slackening, and he no longer felt so helpless in its
grasp. He could not swim at right angles to it
and thus approach the shore directly, but must try
gradually to pull to the left, in a long diagonal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
sweep. Inch by inch, he drew away from the center
of the stream and slowly neared the bank.
Twice he had to dive, to avoid tree trunks that
dashed over the spot where he had been a moment
before. Once he barely escaped being caught between
two houses. But his quick eye and quicker
mind stood him in good stead, at this hour of his
greatest need. His lungs were laboring ready to
burst and his muscles were strained almost to the
breaking point. But his long powerful strokes
brought him steadily nearer to the eastern bank
and he steered straight for a huge tree, that stood
on the edge of the rushing waters. He missed it
by a foot, but was just able to grasp a trailing
branch as he was swept beneath it. A desperate
clutch, a quick swing upward and the ravening
waters had been cheated of a victim. Slowly he
made his way over the bough to the trunk of the
tree, and fell, rather than dropped, to the ground.
Utterly exhausted, he crumpled into a heap and
lay there gasping.</p>

<p>He had escaped death by the narrowest of margins.
Even while he lay there, bereft of strength
and worn out with struggle, the flood reached its
limit, paused a moment and then rushed back. The
receding current met the other still advancing.
Like giant wrestlers, they locked in a fierce embrace,
and the waves shot up for thirty feet. Great
logs flew out of the waves and fell back with a resounding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
crash. Had Bert been in the center of
that seething maelstrom, nothing could have saved
him from instant death.</p>

<p>But he was safe. He had gone into the very
jaws of death and come out alive. Spent and
wrenched and bruised he was, and weary beyond
all telling. Each arm and leg felt as though it
weighed a ton. But he had never incurred pain
or danger in a worthier cause, and he rejoiced at
the chance that had impelled him to take up his
quarters in the deserted hut the night before. The
rain had assuredly been a &ldquo;blessing in disguise,&rdquo;
bitterly as he had regretted it at the time.</p>

<p>A full hour elapsed before he was able to get on
his feet. Had it not been for his splendid physical
condition, he would have utterly collapsed under
the strain. But soon his heart resumed its
normal rhythm, the blood coursed more strongly
through his veins, and he struggled up from his
recumbent posture and began to take note of his
surroundings.</p>

<p>How far he had been carried in that wild ride,
he had no means of knowing. But he judged that
he must be fully six miles from the site of the town.
There had been several turnings in the valley and
from where he stood looking back, he could not
see more than a mile before a bend in the road
cut off his view. But the stream itself was sufficient
guide as he retraced his steps, and he knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
that all too soon he would reach the sad and
stricken crowd that would be camped on the banks,
bewailing the calamity that had come upon them
with the swiftness of a lightning stroke.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch. It had stopped at ten
minutes to five, probably just at the second that the
mountain of water swooped down upon him. He
threw a glance at the sun which was only a little
above the horizon, and concluded that it was not
much more than six o&rsquo;clock. Scarcely more than
an hour had passed, but it seemed to him as though
ages had elapsed since the moment when he had
been startled by that first premonition of danger.</p>

<p>How lucky that he had heeded it! Had he
obeyed his first impulse and disregarded it, he
would have been compelled to stand by, a helpless
spectator, and see a whole community wiped out
of existence. And the bitter memory of that neglected
opportunity would have cast its shadow over
him as long as he lived.</p>

<p>His thoughts went now to the gallant machine
that had carried him so swiftly to the work of rescue.
Good old &ldquo;Blue Streak!&rdquo; Once more it had
proved a tried and trusty comrade, responding to
every call he made upon it. How quickly the miles
would fall away behind him if he only bestrode
it now.</p>

<p>The wish had scarcely been formed before a substitute
appeared. He heard the sound of wheels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and a team came up behind him. The man who
was driving told Bert to jump in, and whipped up
his horses as he hurried on to the scene of the
disaster.</p>

<p>Soon they came upon the homeless throng, huddled
upon the slope that overlooked what had been
home. Some were weeping and running about,
half crazed with anguish. Others were dry-eyed
and dumb, moving as though in a dream, their
minds paralyzed by the shock. They needed everything,
food and tents and medicines and doctors
and nurses. The telegraph and telephone service
was out of commission and the offices had been
swept away. The outside world knew nothing, as
yet, of the frightful visitation that had come to
the little town, nestling in the West Virginia hills.</p>

<p>Bert&rsquo;s resolution was taken on the instant.
There was nothing more that he could do here.
Little, in fact, could be done until the flood subsided,
and there were plenty of hands only too willing
to dull their heartache in work that would keep
them from brooding too much on the disaster. But
no horse could get to the world without as quickly
as he on his motorcycle. He waited only long
enough to learn the shortest route to the next town
of any size. Then he rushed to the thicket on the
hillside where he had left his wheel, and was rejoiced
to find it safe. Fortunately, it had been beyond
the high water mark of the flood. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
dragged it out, mounted, and, with one last look
at the waters that had so nearly been his grave,
threw in the clutch and started up the valley.</p>

<p>The sun was much higher now and the roads,
while still muddy, were rapidly drying out. He
cleared the summit of the hills and could see far
off the buildings and spires of the town he sought.
Like a meteor, he shot down the slope, and in a
few minutes was the center of an excited group in
the telegraph office, to which he at once repaired.
Soon the wires were humming, and within a short
time the entire country, from Maine to California,
was stirred to the depths by the news of the calamity.
Doctors and supplies were rushed from
the points nearest to the stricken town and from
Washington the Federal Government sent a squad
of Red Cross nurses and a detachment of troops
to take charge of the work of rescue and reconstruction.</p>

<p>Only one thing was omitted from Bert&rsquo;s graphic
recital of the story. He said not a word of his
wild ride in the early dawn. Others, later on,
when they had regained something of composure
and could recall events preceding the catastrophe,
remembered a rider rushing along the country
roads and calling upon them to flee for their lives.
They told of the siren, shrieking like a soul in pain,
that had roused them from their sleep with its
dreadful warning. The reporters, avid of sensation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
listened eagerly, and embroidered upon the
story some fanciful embellishments of their own.
They did their utmost to discover the name of the
rider who had come racing through the mists of
that early morning, but failed. The only one who
could tell the truth about it never did. Except
to a few of his intimates, and that under the pledge
of secrecy, Bert locked the story in his own breast
and threw away the key. It was enough for him
that he had been able at a critical juncture to do,
and do successfully, the work that stood ready to
his hand. The deed carried its own compensation,
and he rejoiced that he was able to keep it from
public view. But, somewhere in West Virginia,
a crippled boy remembered him gratefully, and
two little youngsters were taught to mention a
nameless stranger in their prayers.</p>

<p>And now that nothing was left to do in behalf of
others, Bert&rsquo;s thoughts reverted to his own affairs.
The day was still young, despite the events that had
been crowded into it. Up to this moment he had
not thought of food, but now he was conscious
that he was ravenously hungry. As soon as he
could shake himself loose from the crowd that had
listened breathlessly to his story, he went to the
hotel and ordered an abundant breakfast. When
he had finished, he was once more his normal self.
He replenished his gasoline supply, consulted his
map, jumped into the saddle and was off. Before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
long he reached the road that he had been traveling
the previous day; and, bending low over the
handlebars, he called upon the &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo; to make
up for lost time.</p>

<p>The scenery flew past as in a panorama. Up
hill and down he went at railroad speed, only
slackened within the limits of a town. In this
thinly settled country, these were few and far between,
and he chuckled as he saw his speedometer
swiftly climbing. The roads were drying out, and,
though still a little heavy, had lost their clinging
quality. In a few hours, he flashed into Charleston,
where his ears were greeted by the cries of the
newsboys, calling out the extras issued on account
of the flood. Staying only long enough to report
his time and get a meal, he resumed his trip, and,
before night, had left the worst part of the hills
behind him and had crossed the border line into
Kentucky, the land of swift horses and fair women,
of Davy Crockett and Daniel Boone, the &ldquo;dark
and bloody ground&rdquo; of the Revolution.</p>

<p>It was a tired rider who almost fell from his
saddle that night, after having covered three hundred
miles. A fierce determination had buoyed him
up and the most daring kind of rough riding had
carried him through. Now the reaction had set
in. An immense weariness weighed him down and
every separate muscle had its own distinctive ache.
But his mind was at peace. He had fought a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
fight. A supreme emergency had challenged him,
and he had met it squarely. And no twinges of
conscience for duty unperformed came to disturb
the sleep of utter exhaustion into which he fell
as soon as his head touched the pillow.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Kentucky Feud</span></h3>


<p class="cap">The following morning he arose early, his
abounding vitality having enabled him to recuperate
entirely from the exciting events of the
day before. He was soon in the saddle, bowling
along at a good clip through the &ldquo;Blue Grass&rdquo;
State. He found widely varied road conditions
confronting him. At times he would strike short
stretches of &ldquo;pike&rdquo; that afforded fairly good going.
As a rule, however, the roads were sandy,
and consequently, very bad for motorcycle travel.</p>

<p>At times, the sand was so deep that he felt
lucky if he averaged fifteen or twenty miles an
hour. Often the only way he could get along at
all was to ride in one of the ruts worn by the wheels
of carriages and buggies. These were usually very
deep, so deep, in fact, that with both wheels in
them the footboards barely cleared the surface of
the road. Of course, this made riding very dangerous,
as the slightest turn of the front wheel
meant a bad fall.</p>

<p>It was only by skilful balancing that Bert managed
to make any progress at all. As every one
knows, a bicycle or motorcycle is kept erect by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
moving the front wheel to one side or the other,
thus maintaining the proper center of gravity. Riding
in a rut, however, this method became impracticable,
so Bert was forced to keep his equilibrium
by swaying his body from side to side, as
necessity dictated.</p>

<p>He found that the faster he traveled through
these ruts the easier it was to keep his balance. Of
course, if he had a tumble going at that speed he
was much more apt to be badly hurt, but he had
no time to think of that. If he didn&rsquo;t go fast, he
couldn&rsquo;t win the race, and to him that was reason
enough to &ldquo;hit it up&rdquo; regardless of possible consequences.</p>

<p>Sometimes he met a carriage, and then there
was nothing for it but to dismount and wait for it
to pass, that is, if he thought the driver had not
seen him. But if he was on a long stretch of road
and the driver had ample time to get out of the
way,&mdash;well, there was no stopping then. The
driver, seeing a blue streak approaching him at
close to a mile a minute clip would hastily draw
to one side of the road and then descend and hold
his horse&rsquo;s head; and usually none too soon. There
would come a rattle and roar, and Bert would be
a speck in the distance, leaving a cloud of dust to
settle slowly behind him.</p>

<p>The driver, after quieting his horse&mdash;all the
horses in this part of the country were unused to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
motor vehicles of any kind&mdash;would resume his journey,
muttering curses on them &ldquo;pesky gasoline critters.&rdquo;
But taken altogether, Bert found his first
day in Kentucky one of the most strenuous he had
ever experienced.</p>

<p>Night found him in a rather unlooked for situation.
He was a little ahead of his schedule, and
he had reached the town at which he had planned
to stay several hours short of sundown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No use losing three or four precious hours of
daylight,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I might as well push forward
and take a chance of getting shelter at some
village along the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This he did, following directions given him in
the town in which he had originally intended to
stay. As usual, however, the directions proved to
be wrong, and the village failed to materialize.
To add to his troubles as darkness came on, he
took a wrong fork in the road, and before long
found himself in a road that was absolutely impassable
on account of sand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;it begins to look like a
night in the open for me, and that won&rsquo;t be much
fun. I want to get a good night&rsquo;s sleep to-night.
Heaven knows I need it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when he had just about resigned himself
to this, he was relieved to see a light spring up,
some distance away. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; he thought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see if all I&rsquo;ve heard about Kentucky hospitality
is fact or just mere talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly he started the motor and threw in
the clutch on low speed. He made no attempt to
mount, however, but contented himself with walking
beside the machine, guiding it through the deep
sand.</p>

<p>He had no need to announce his arrival. The
unmuffled exhaust did that for him. As he approached
the cabin from which the light emanated,
he could see the whole family grouped on the doorstep,
peering into the night, for by now it was quite
dark.</p>

<p>The head of the house was a little in advance
of the others, and as Bert and the &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo;
approached the door he stepped forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wall, stranger, what kind of a contraption do
you-all reckon to have thar?&rdquo; he drawled, gazing
curiously at the palpitating motorcycle.</p>

<p>Bert shut off the motor before he replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s my motorcycle, and
it&rsquo;s one of the best friends I have. I took the
wrong road a way back, I guess, and I was just going
to camp out over night, when I saw the light
from your window. If you can put me up for the
night you&rsquo;ll be doing me a big favor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not another word, son,&rdquo; replied the big mountaineer,
&ldquo;come right in an&rsquo; set down. You look
nigh dead beat.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am about all in,&rdquo; confessed Bert. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave
my machine right here, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shore, shore,&rdquo; said the big Kentuckian, &ldquo;I
reckin thar ain&rsquo;t nobuddy within a hundred miles
hereabouts that could make off with the blamed
machine ef he had a mind to. Hosses is considerable
more common in these parts. The pump&rsquo;s
around the side of the house ef you &rsquo;low to wash
up,&rdquo; he continued, as an afterthought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, thanks,&rdquo; replied Bert, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be with
you in no time.&rdquo; He disappeared in the direction
indicated, and soon returned, much refreshed by a
thorough sousing under the pump.</p>

<p>As he entered the cabin, a tired-looking but
motherly woman bustled forward. &ldquo;Jest you set
over there to the right of paw,&rdquo; she said, indicating
Bert&rsquo;s place at the table, &ldquo;an&rsquo; make yourself
comfortable. We ain&rsquo;t got much to offer you, but
sech as it is, you&rsquo;r welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was not much variety to the viands, it
must be confessed, but there was plenty of &ldquo;corn
pone&rdquo; and bacon, and rich milk with which to
wash it down. After his strenuous day in the open
he ate ravenously. The mountaineer uttered hardly
a word during the meal, and indeed none of the
family seemed very talkative.</p>

<p>The children, of whom there were six, gazed
round-eyed at the unexpected guest, and seemed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
if one were to judge from their looks, to regard
him as a being from another world.</p>

<p>After the meal was dispatched, the mountaineer
produced a blackened old pipe, and, filling it from
a shabby leather pouch, lit it. &ldquo;Do you smoke,
son?&rdquo; he asked, holding the pouch out to Bert, &ldquo;ef
you do, help yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; said Bert, declining the hospitable
offer with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t smoke, eh?&rdquo; commented the other.
&ldquo;Wall, ye&rsquo;d ought to. There&rsquo;s a heap of comfort
in baccy, let me tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t doubt it,&rdquo; replied Bert, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve been
in training so long for one thing or another that
I&rsquo;ve never had a chance to form the habit. Everybody
that smokes seems to get a lot of fun out of
it though, so I suppose it must be a great pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It shore is,&rdquo; affirmed the big Kentuckian.
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s hot in here. What do you say we light
out and take a squint at that machine of yourn?
I ain&rsquo;t never got a good look at one close up.
They&rsquo;re ginerally travelin&rsquo; too fast to make out details,&rdquo;
with a grin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;re not the slowest things in the
world, that&rsquo;s certain,&rdquo; laughed Bert, &ldquo;but come
ahead out and I&rsquo;ll be glad to explain it to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went outside together, the Kentuckian carrying
a lantern, and followed by the children, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
gazed wide-eyed at the strange machine. Bert explained
the simpler points of the mechanism to
the mountaineer, who seemed much interested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I kin see it&rsquo;s a mighty neat contraption,&rdquo; he
admitted, at length. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d rether ride quietlike
behind a good bit o&rsquo; hoss flesh. You can&rsquo;t
make me believe that thet machine has got the
strength o&rsquo; seven hosses in it, nohow. It ain&rsquo;t reasonable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert saw that he might argue for a week, and
still fail to shake the obstinacy of his host, so he
wisely forbore to make the attempt. Instead he
guided the conversation around to the conditions
and pursuits of the surrounding country, and here
the Kentuckian was on firm ground. He discoursed
on local politics with considerable shrewdness
and good sense, and proved himself well up
on such topics.</p>

<p>They talked on this subject quite a while, and
then the conversation in some way shifted to the
feuds a few years back that had aroused such widespread
criticism. &ldquo;Although I haven&rsquo;t seen any
sign of them since I&rsquo;ve been in Kentucky,&rdquo; confessed
Bert, with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said his host, with a ruminative look in
his eyes, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re dyin&rsquo; out, an&rsquo; a good thing it is
fer the country, too. They never did do the least
mite o&rsquo; good, an&rsquo; they often did a sight o&rsquo; harm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it warn&rsquo;t such a long time back that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
Judsons an&rsquo; the Berkeleys were at it hammer an&rsquo;
tongs, right in this country roundabout. One was
layin&rsquo; fer &rsquo;tother all the time, an&rsquo; the folks thet
wasn&rsquo;t in the fracas was afraid to go huntin&rsquo; even,
fer fear o&rsquo; bein&rsquo; picked off by mistake. They
wasn&rsquo;t none too particular about makin&rsquo; sure o&rsquo;
their man, neither, before they pulled trigger.
They&rsquo;d shoot fust, an&rsquo; ef they found they&rsquo;d bagged
the wrong man they might be peeved, but thet&rsquo;s
all. More&rsquo;n once I&rsquo;ve had a close shave myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what started the feud in the first place?&rdquo;
asked Bert. &ldquo;It must have been a pretty big thing
to have set people to shooting each other up like
that, I should think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so&rsquo;s you could notice it,&rdquo; was the answer.
&ldquo;Blamed ef I rightly remember just what it was.
Seems to me, now I come to think of it, that ole
Seth Judson an&rsquo; Adam Berkeley got mixed up in
the fust place over cuttin&rsquo; down a tree thet was
smack on the line &rsquo;atween their farms. Ole Seth
he swore he&rsquo;d cut thet tree down, an&rsquo; Adam he
&rsquo;lowed as how it would be a mighty unhealthy thing
fer any man as how even took a chip out of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wall, a couple o&rsquo; days later Adam went to
town on one errand or another, and when he got
back the cussed ole tree had been cut down an&rsquo;
carted away. When Adam saw nothin&rsquo; but the
stump left, he never said a word, good or bad, but
turned around and went back to his house an&rsquo; got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
his gun. He tracks over to Seth Judson&rsquo;s house
an&rsquo; calls him by name. Seth, he walks out large as
life, an&rsquo; Adam pumps a bullet clean through his
heart. Them two men had been friends off an&rsquo;
on fer over thirty year, an&rsquo; I allow thet ef Adam
hed took time to think an&rsquo; cool off a little, he&rsquo;d
never a&rsquo; done what he did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Howsomever, there&rsquo;s no bringin&rsquo; the dead back
to life, an&rsquo; Adam tromps off home, leavin&rsquo; Seth
lyin&rsquo; there on his front porch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t more&rsquo;n a week later, I reckon, when
we all heard thet Seth&rsquo;s son, Jed, had up an&rsquo; killed
Adam, shootin&rsquo; at him from behind a fence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Waal, thet&rsquo;s the way it started, an&rsquo; it seemed
as though it war never goin&rsquo; to end. Young Adam,
he &rsquo;lowed as how no man could shoot his daddy
an&rsquo; live, so he laid fer Jed as he was goin&rsquo; to the
village, an&rsquo; shot him &rsquo;atween the eyes as neat as
could be. Then the younger sons, thet were still
not much more than boys, as you might say, they
took to lyin&rsquo; in wait fer each other in the woods
an&rsquo; behind fences. Pretty soon their relatives took
to backin&rsquo; them up, and jined in on their own account.
O&rsquo; course, most o&rsquo; the folks hereabouts is
related to one another in some way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t a native o&rsquo; these parts myself, an&rsquo; so
managed to keep clear o&rsquo; the trouble. It was a
hard thing for me to set by an&rsquo; see my neighbors
killin&rsquo; each other off like a passel o&rsquo; mad dogs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
though, an&rsquo; all the more because I knew there
wasn&rsquo;t any real call fer it in the first place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Howsumever, they&rsquo;ve stopped fightin&rsquo; now, an&rsquo;
it&rsquo;s none too soon, nuther. Another year, an&rsquo; I
reckon there wouldn&rsquo;t a been a Berkeley or a Judson
left alive in the hull State.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The farmer stopped speaking, and gazed reflectively
into the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what put an end to it finally,&rdquo; inquired
Bert, who had listened to this narrative with absorbed
interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Waal, there was considerable romance consarned
in it, as you might say,&rdquo; said his host.
&ldquo;Young Buck Judson, he met one o&rsquo; ole Berkeley&rsquo;s
daughters somewhere, an&rsquo; those two young fools
hed to go an&rsquo; fall in love with each other. O&rsquo;
course, their families were dead sot agin&rsquo; it, but
nothin&rsquo; would do the critters short o&rsquo; gettin&rsquo; hitched
up, an&rsquo; at last they talked their families into a
peace meetin&rsquo;, as you might say. All the neighbors
was invited, an&rsquo; o&rsquo; course we-all went. An&rsquo;, believe
me, those people reminded me of a room full o&rsquo;
tom cats, all wantin&rsquo; to start a shindy, but all hatin&rsquo;
to be the fust to begin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But all we-&rsquo;uns thet wanted to stop such goin&rsquo;s
on did our best to keep peace in the family. To
make a long story short, everythin&rsquo; went off quiet
an&rsquo; easy like, an&rsquo; Buck an&rsquo; his gal was hitched up
all proper. The hard feelin&rsquo; gradually calmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
down, an&rsquo; now the two families is tolerable good
friends, considerin&rsquo; everything. But that cost a
heap of more or less valable lives while it lasted,
I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a short pause, he continued, &ldquo;But there
was some turrible strong feelin&rsquo;s on both sides
while it lasted, son. Why, people was afraid to
get &rsquo;atween a light an&rsquo; a winder, for fear of a bullet
comin&rsquo; through and puttin&rsquo; a sudden an&rsquo; onpleasant
end to them. Ole Sam Judson, as how
always had a streak o&rsquo; yaller in him at the best
o&rsquo; times, got so at last thet he wouldn&rsquo;t stir out o&rsquo;
the house without he toted his little gran&rsquo;darter,
Mary, along with him. O&rsquo; course, he figured thet
with the baby in his arms nobuddy&rsquo;d take a chanst
on wingin&rsquo; him and mebbe killin&rsquo; the kid, an&rsquo; he
was right. He never even got scratched the hull
time. An&rsquo; I could tell you a hundred other things
o&rsquo; the same kind, only you&rsquo;d probably get tired listenin&rsquo;
to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It certainly was a bad state of things,&rdquo; said
Bert at last, after a thoughtful silence, &ldquo;but couldn&rsquo;t
the authorities do something to stop such wholesale
killing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; replied the mountaineer, &ldquo;it would
&rsquo;a taken every constable in Kentucky to cover this
part o&rsquo; the country, an&rsquo; even then I reckon there
wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a been anywhere near enough. They
must &rsquo;a realized that,&rdquo; he added drily, &ldquo;&rsquo;cause they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
didn&rsquo;t try very hard, leastways, not as fur as I
could see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s over now, at any rate,&rdquo; commented
Bert. &ldquo;A needless waste of life like that is a terrible
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It shore is,&rdquo; agreed his host, and puffed meditatively
at his pipe. At last he knocked the ashes
from it and rose to his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; late, son,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I reckon
you-all must be might tuckered out after a day on
that there fire spoutin&rsquo; motorbike o&rsquo; yourn. The
ole lady&rsquo;s got a bunk fixed up fer you, I reckon, an&rsquo;
you can turn in any time you feel like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am tired out, for a fact,&rdquo; acknowledged Bert,
&ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t care how soon I tumble in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come along, then,&rdquo; said Anderson, as his host
was named, &ldquo;come on inside, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll put you
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he entered the cabin, followed by
Bert.</p>

<p>Mrs. Anderson had fixed a bed for him in a
little loft over the main room, reached by a ladder.
After bidding his host and hostess good
night, Bert climbed the rungs and ten minutes later
was sleeping soundly.</p>

<p>When he was awakened by a call from the
farmer, he jumped up much refreshed, and, dressing
quickly, descended the ladder to the living
room, where the entire family was already assembled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
After exchanging greetings, he took his
place at the table and made a substantial meal
from plain but hearty fare.</p>

<p>This over, he bade a cordial farewell to the kind
farmer and his wife, who refused pointblank to accept
the slightest payment for the hospitality they
had extended him. Bert thanked them again and
again, and then shook hands and left them, first
being told of a short cut that would save him several
miles and land him on a good road.</p>

<p>The good old &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo; was in fine shape,
and after a few minor adjustments he started the
motor. The whole family had followed him out,
and were grouped in an interested semicircle about
him. At last he was ready to start, and threw one
leg over the saddle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he called, waving his hand, &ldquo;and
thanks once more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, good luck,&rdquo; they cried in chorus, and
Bert moved off slowly, on low gear.</p>

<p>At first the going was atrocious, and he was
forced to pick his way with great caution. The
road steadily improved, however, and in a short
time a sudden turn brought him out on an exceptionally
good turnpike, the one of which his host
of the night before had told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he thought to himself, &ldquo;here goes
to make speed while the road lasts,&rdquo; and he grinned
at this paraphrase of a well-worn saying. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
opened up more and more, and his motor took up
its familiar deep-toned road song. Mile after mile
raced back from the spinning wheels. The indicator
on the speedometer reached the fifty mark, and
stayed there hour after hour. At times the road
ran more to sand, but then he simply opened the
throttle a trifle wider, and kept to the same speed.</p>

<p>The air was like wine, and riding was a keen
pleasure. The trees and bushes waving in the early
morning breeze&mdash;the beautiful green country
spread out on every side&mdash;the steady, exhilarating
speed&mdash;all made life seem a very fine thing indeed,
and Bert sang snatches of wild, meaningless songs
as he flew along. For three hours he never slackened
speed, and then only pulled up in a fair-sized
town to replenish his oil and gasoline. Then he
was off again. The road became worse after he
had gone ten or fifteen miles, but still he contrived
to make fair time, and about noon he rode into
Louisville.</p>

<p>His arrival there was eagerly awaited, and he
was warmly received at the local agency. While
his machine was being cleaned and oiled, he took
the opportunity of reporting to the proper authorities.
Upon his return the &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo; was
turned over to him, shining and polished, and he
once more took the road. Several motorcyclists
accompanied him to the outskirts of the city. He
experienced varying road conditions, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
twice delayed by punctures. But the rattling work
of the early morning made up for the afternoon&rsquo;s
delays, and dusk found him two hundred and
eighty miles nearer the goal of his ambition.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Forged Telegram</span></h3>


<p class="cap">Bert&rsquo;s stay in Louisville was brief, and all
the more so, because neither Tom nor Dick
was there to meet him, as they had planned. Bert
took it for granted that something out of the ordinary
had happened, however, and bore his disappointment
as philosophically as he could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt they&rsquo;ve been delayed,&rdquo; he thought,
&ldquo;and will meet me in the next town. That will be
a spur to me to go faster so that I can see them
sooner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had a refreshing sleep, and was up early,
resolved to make a profitable day of it. After he
had eaten breakfast, he paid his bill, and was just
going out the door when the clerk stopped him.
&ldquo;Just a minute, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a telegram
for you. I almost forgot to give it to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did it come?&rdquo; asked Bert, as he took the
yellow envelope and prepared to open it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, just about an hour ago,&rdquo; replied the clerk,
&ldquo;no bad news I hope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This question was occasioned no doubt by the
expression of Bert&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Come quick,&rdquo; the telegram<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
read, &ldquo;Tom very sick; may die. We are in
Maysville. Dick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert&rsquo;s voice shook as he addressed the hotel
clerk. &ldquo;One of my friends is very sick,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in Maysville. How long will it take me to
get there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a matter of close on two hundred
miles,&rdquo; replied the clerk, in a sympathetic voice,
&ldquo;but the roads are fair, and you can make pretty
fast time with that machine of yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert whipped out his map of Kentucky, and the
clerk pointed out to him the little dot marked
Maysville.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, thanks,&rdquo; said Bert, briefly, &ldquo;good-bye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;I hope your friend
isn&rsquo;t as bad as you fear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But before he finished speaking Bert was on the
&ldquo;Blue Streak,&rdquo; and was flying down the street.
In a moment his mind had grasped every angle of
the catastrophe. If he went to Tom, it would very
likely mean the loss of the race, for a matter of
four hundred miles out of his road would be a fearful
handicap. But what was the race compared to
dear old Tom, Tom, who at this very moment
might be calling for him? Every other consideration
wiped from his mind, Bert leaned over and
fairly flew along the dusty road. Fences, trees,
houses, streaked past him, and still he rode faster<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and faster, recklessly, taking chances that he would
have shunned had he been bound on any other errand.
He shot around sharp bends in the road at
breakneck speed, sometimes escaping running into
the ditch by a margin of an inch or so. Fast as
the &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo; was, it was all too slow to keep
pace with his feverish impatience, and Bert fumed
at the long miles that lay between him and his
friend.</p>

<p>Now a steep hill loomed up in front of him,
and he rushed it at breakneck speed. Slowly the
motorcycle lost speed under the awful drag of the
steep ascent, and at last Bert was forced to change
to low gear. The &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo; toiled upward,
and at last reached the top. A wonderful view lay
spread out before him, but Bert had no eye just
now for the beauties of nature. All he saw was a
road that dipped and curved below him until it
was lost in the green shades of a valley. Bert saw
he would have no need of his motor in making that
descent, so threw out the clutch and coasted. Faster
and faster he flew, gaining speed with every
revolution of the wheels. With the engine stopped,
the motorcycle swept along in absolute silence, save
for the slight hissing noise made by the contact of
the tires with the road. The speed augmented
until he was traveling almost with the speed of a
cannon ball. At this speed, brakes were useless,
even had he been inclined to use them, which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
was not. Two-thirds of the way down he flashed
past a wagon, that was negotiating the descent with
one wheel chained, so steep was it. Had the slightest
thing gone wrong then; had a nut worked loose,
a tire punctured, a chain broken or jumped the
sprockets, Bert would have been hurled through
the air like a stone from a catapult. Fortunately
for him, everything held, and now he was nearing
the bottom of the hill. Ten seconds later, and
he was sweeping up the opposite slope at a speed
that it seemed could never slacken. But gradually
gravitation slowed him down to a safer pace, and
at last he slipped in the clutch and started the
motor. In the wild descent his cap had flown off,
but he hardly noticed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll soon be there at this rate,&rdquo; he thought,
glancing at the speedometer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come over a
hundred and fifty miles now, so Maysville can&rsquo;t be
much further.&rdquo; And, indeed, less than an hour&rsquo;s
additional riding brought him to the town of that
name.</p>

<p>He went immediately to the hotel at which his
friends were supposed to be. But when he stated
his object to the hotel clerk, the latter gazed at him
blankly. &ldquo;There are no parties of that name stopping
here,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I guess you have the wrong
address, young man.&rdquo; Bert showed him the telegram,
but the clerk only shook his head. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
something wrong somewhere,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
you see Bently, the telegrapher. He could probably
give you a description of the person that sent
the telegram, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks, I will,&rdquo; said Bert, and hastened out.
A dim idea of the true state of affairs was beginning
to form in his brain, but it hardly seemed possible
his suspicions could be true. He soon reached
the telegraph office, and accosted the operator.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;who sent that
telegram early this morning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The station agent glanced at the telegram, and
replied: &ldquo;Why, I can&rsquo;t give you a very good description
of the man, for I didn&rsquo;t take special notice
of him. He was a young man of medium build,
though, with light hair, and now I come to think of
it, he wore goggles. Seems to me I heard some one
say he was riding a motorcycle in some cross country
race, but that I can&rsquo;t vouch for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I know who he was, all right,&rdquo; said
Bert, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m much obliged to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it,&rdquo; returned the other, and
turned again to his work.</p>

<p>Bert walked out of the station with clenched
fists and blazing eyes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Hayward who sent
that telegram,&rdquo; he muttered, between clenched
teeth. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d stake my soul on it. But I&rsquo;ll win this
race in spite of that crook and his tricks. And
anyway,&rdquo; he thought, with his eyes softening,
&ldquo;old Tom <i>isn&rsquo;t</i> sick after all, and that&rsquo;s almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
enough to make me forgive Hayward. I feel as
though I had just awakened from an awful nightmare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was characteristic of Bert that his anger and
chagrin at being tricked in this dastardly way were
swallowed up in his relief at finding the report of
his friend&rsquo;s illness false.</p>

<p>Bert consulted his map, and found that by taking
a different route than that by which he had
come he could save quite some distance, and started
out again, after filling the &ldquo;Blue Streak&rsquo;s&rdquo; tanks
with oil and gasoline, with the grim resolve to have
revenge for the despicable trick that had been
played on him, by snatching from Hayward the
prize that he was willing to stoop to such depths
to gain.</p>

<p>Up hill and down he flew, around curves, over
bridges that shook and rattled at the impact of
racing man and machine. Steadily the mileage indicator
slipped around, as league after league
rolled backward, and Bert exulted as he watched it.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make it ahead of everybody else or die in
the attempt, won&rsquo;t we, old fellow?&rdquo; he said, apostrophizing
the &ldquo;Blue Streak.&rdquo; &ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s going
to play a trick like that on us and get away with
it, are they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Only once on the return trip did he stop, and
then only long enough to snatch a little food. Then
he was off again like the wind, and as dusk began<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to fall rode into Louisville. As he entered the
hotel, after leaving his machine in a garage, Dick
and Tom swooped down upon him. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;
they demanded, both in the same breath, &ldquo;who sent
that telegram, do you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I know,&rdquo; replied Bert. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a
doubt in the world that it was sent by Hayward.
You remember that we heard he was more or less
crooked, and now we know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I could lay my hands on him,&rdquo; exclaimed
Dick, with flashing eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d make him regret the
day he was born. Just you wait till the next time
I come across him, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I see him first there won&rsquo;t be anything left
for you,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;Of all the dirty, underhanded
tricks I ever heard of, that is the limit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t contradict you,&rdquo; said Bert,
grimly, &ldquo;but all he&rsquo;ll ever gain out of it will be a
sound thrashing. Don&rsquo;t you believe for a minute
that it&rsquo;s going to help him win this race. I&rsquo;ll ride
day and night until I&rsquo;ve made up for this lost
time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And ride he did, crowding three days&rsquo; mileage
into two, until at last he felt that he had recovered
the time lost in answering the call of the forged
telegram.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">In Deadly Peril</span></h3>


<p class="cap">It was after he reached the Western deserts that
Bert experienced the hardest going. The roads,
if mere trails could be dignified by that name, were
unspeakably bad, and time and again he was forced
to ride on the railroad embankment, between the
tracks. Of course, progress in this manner was
necessarily slow, and again and again Bert had
occasion to feel grateful for the wonderful springing
system of his mount. Without some such aid,
he felt his task would be well nigh hopeless.</p>

<p>As it was, he had to let a little air out of the
tires, to reduce the shocks caused by contact with
the rough ballast and uneven ties. In some places,
where the roadbed was exceptionally well ballasted
he was able to open up a little, but such stretches
were few and far between. In places he was forced
to dismount because of drainage culverts running
under the tracks. When this happened he would
lift the &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo; up on a rail and trundle it
over. It was back-breaking work, and tested even
his courage and endurance to the utmost.</p>

<p>His oil and gasoline supply ran low, but by great
good fortune he was able to secure almost a gallon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
of gasoline from an agent at a lonely little station,
and about a quart of very inferior lubricating oil.
But he comforted himself with the thought that
&ldquo;half a loaf is better than none&rdquo; and went on.
After a while he noticed that a passable looking
road skirted the railroad to the left, and he resolved
to try it.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he scrambled down the steep embankment,
the &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo; half rolling and half
sliding down with him. He arrived safely at the
bottom, and a minute later was on the road. It
proved to be fairly good at first, but became more
and more sandy, and at last Bert was brought to a
standstill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m through for to-day,&rdquo; he reflected,
and gazed anxiously in every direction for any sign
of human habitation. His searching gaze met
nothing but empty sky and empty desert, however,
and he drew a sigh of resignation. &ldquo;I guess there&rsquo;s
nothing for it but to camp out here and make the
best of things,&rdquo; he thought, and set about unstrapping
his impedimenta from the luggage carrier.</p>

<p>His preparations for the night were soon made.
He smoothed out a patch of sand and spread his
thick army blanket over it. &ldquo;Now that that&rsquo;s
done,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just have a bite to eat, and
turn in. This isn&rsquo;t half bad, after all. It&rsquo;s a lot
better than some of the hotels I&rsquo;ve put up at on
this trip, and the ventilation is perfect.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>He always carried a substantial lunch with him,
to guard against emergencies, and of this he now
partook heartily. When he had finished, he busied
himself in cleaning and thoroughly inspecting his
faithful mount, and found it in fine condition, even
after such a strenuous day. &ldquo;No need to worry
about your not delivering the goods, is there, old
boy?&rdquo; he said, affectionately. &ldquo;As long as you
stick to the job, we&rsquo;ll pull through all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the time he had completed his inspection and
made some adjustments it was almost dark, and
Bert rolled himself in his blanket and was soon
sleeping soundly.</p>

<p>Meantime Tom and Dick were awaiting him at
Boyd, a small town in Northern Texas. When he
failed to arrive, they decided that some unforeseen
event had delayed him, and were not much worried.
Nevertheless, they were not quite easy about
him, and Tom made a proposition that met with
instant approbation from Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t it be a good idea,&rdquo; Tom proposed,
&ldquo;to hire an automobile early to-morrow
morning and meet him outside the town on his way
in? It will break up the trip a little for him, and
then, in case he&rsquo;s had a breakdown we can help him
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo; agreed Dick, enthusiastically, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go
out right now and make arrangements with the
garage keeper so we&rsquo;ll be sure to get the machine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
in the morning. We might as well be on the safe
side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They immediately sallied out to put this plan in
execution. They experienced no difficulty in making
the necessary arrangements. They paid the
proprietor of the garage a deposit, and so secured
the use of a fast, two-seated runabout for the following
morning.</p>

<p>Before they left Dick asked the proprietor at
what time the place was open. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s always
open,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;come and get the car any time
you want it. It&rsquo;s all the same to me, so long as it&rsquo;s
paid for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll take you at your word,&rdquo; they
promised, and returned to the hotel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get a good early start,&rdquo; planned Tom,
&ldquo;we ought to leave the garage before six o&rsquo;clock
if we expect to meet Bert in time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do just that,&rdquo; agreed Dick, &ldquo;and maybe
I won&rsquo;t be glad to set eyes on the old reprobate
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, too,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;he&rsquo;ll be a sight for sore
eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what,&rdquo; agreed Dick, &ldquo;but if we&rsquo;re going
to get started at that unearthly hour, we&rsquo;d better
turn in early to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This proposition being self-evident, it met with
no opposition, and shortly afterward they retired,
leaving an early call at the office.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>They were awakened punctually the next morning,
and tumbled hastily into their clothes. They
did not even stop for breakfast, arguing &ldquo;that there
would be plenty of time for that later on.&rdquo; In a
very short time they presented themselves at the
garage, and the party in charge, following instructions
left with him by the owner of the place, turned
the automobile over to them.</p>

<p>Dick took the wheel, and they were soon spinning
rapidly through the quiet streets of the town.
Once outside the limits, Dick &ldquo;cracked on speed,&rdquo;
and they went along at a fast clip. They passed
right by the place where Bert had encamped at a
distance of several miles, and before long came to
a village, where they inquired if Bert had been
through. No, the villagers said, he had not been
through there, but they had heard that a motorcyclist
had been seen riding on the railroad embankment,
and there could be little doubt that the
rider was Bert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have passed him somewhere,&rdquo; concluded
one of their informants, an old native whose
tanned and weather-beaten face was seamed by a
thousand wrinkles. &ldquo;P&rsquo;raps he stuck to the railroad
tracks clean through, an&rsquo; is in Boyd by this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Dick shook his head. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;d followed the
tracks right along he&rsquo;d probably have reached town
last night,&rdquo; he said, with an anxious look in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s left the track for one reason
or another, and lost his way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there any road near the track that he might
have used?&rdquo; queried Tom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, there ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; replied the veteran, &ldquo;leastways,
nothin&rsquo; except the old Holloway trail, and
you can&rsquo;t rightly call that a road. It&rsquo;s most wiped
out now, an&rsquo; jest leads plumb to nowhere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just the same,&rdquo; exclaimed Dick, excitedly,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s just what has happened.&rdquo; He explained
hurriedly the race and its object, and ended by entreating
the old plainsman to guide them to the
road he had spoken of.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Waal, all right,&rdquo; exclaimed the old man, after
a moment of hesitation, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go ye. But whareabouts
in that gasoline buggy o&rsquo; yourn am I goin&rsquo;
to sit? Thar don&rsquo;t seem to be much room to
spare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You sit here,&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, jumping out.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sit on the floor and hold on somehow. Let
her go, Dick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before the plainsman had fairly settled himself
in the seat Dick had let in the clutch, and the car
started away with a jerk, Dick steering according
to directions given him by the old man as they went
along. They plowed through the sand at a breakneck
pace, Tom hanging on for dear life. Soon
they came in sight of the railroad embankment,
and Dick slowed down slightly. Their guide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
waved his arm to the right, and Dick wrenched the
wheel around, causing the machine to skid wildly
in the yielding sand. Their guide hung on desperately,
but was heard to mutter something about
&ldquo;stickin&rsquo; to hosses after this.&rdquo; Soon they reached
the road that Bert had traversed the night before,
and there, sure enough, were the marks of motorcycle
tires. Their guide gave a whoop. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
close on his trail now,&rdquo; he yelled, &ldquo;give this tarnation
machine a touch o&rsquo; the spurs, young feller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick followed out the spirit of this admonition,
at any rate, and after ten minutes of furious driving
they caught sight of the &ldquo;Blue Streak.&rdquo; A little
further, and they could make out Bert&rsquo;s recumbent
form, apparently asleep.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; exclaimed Tom, heaving a sigh of relief
as Dick reduced speed, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve had all our
worry for nothing, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the old plainsman was peering out from under
his horny palm. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s almighty queer,&rdquo; he
muttered under his breath. &ldquo;That young chap
must be an all-fired heavy sleeper to sleep in broad
daylight like that. Let&rsquo;s get out an&rsquo; walk the rest
o&rsquo; the way,&rdquo; he continued, aloud.</p>

<p>Dick looked at him curiously, but did as he proposed,
and brought the car to a standstill. They
all got out, and Tom and Dick were going to make
a dash for the sleeper, but their guide held them
back. &ldquo;Easy boys, easy,&rdquo; he cautioned. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
somethin&rsquo; wrong here, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve an idee I know what
it is, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s whatever!&rdquo; he exclaimed, when they
had advanced cautiously a few steps further.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;s a bunch o&rsquo; scorpions has crawled up on
him durin&rsquo; the night to keep warm, an&rsquo; if he moves
an eyelash they&rsquo;ll sting him, sure. An&rsquo; ef they
do&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he stopped significantly, and the two
friends of the threatened man paled as they
realized the full horror of the situation.</p>

<p>Here was their friend menaced by a hideous
death, and they found themselves powerless to help
him. They were within a hundred feet of him, but
to all intents and purposes they might as well have
been a hundred miles distant. The first attempt
on their part to help him would only precipitate the
very tragedy that they sought to avoid.</p>

<p>Bert lay in the shadow cast by the &ldquo;Blue Streak,&rdquo;
over which he had thrown a blanket to protect it
from wind-blown sand. The hideous creatures
would not leave him until the sun drove them into
hiding, and Bert might wake at any moment. What
to do they knew not. They racked their brains desperately
for some plan of action, but could think
of none.</p>

<p>It was the old frontiersman who came to their
rescue. &ldquo;Ef I only had a bit o&rsquo; lookin&rsquo; glass,&rdquo; he
muttered, looking aimlessly about him, &ldquo;I might do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
somethin&rsquo;. But they probably ain&rsquo;t no sech thing
nearer than ten miles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that would do any good I can get you one,&rdquo;
exclaimed Tom, seized with an inspiration. He
raced back to the auto, and, seizing a wrench,
attacked the mirror attached to the dash for the
purpose of reflecting objects coming in back of the
car. He had it off in less time than it takes to tell,
and ran back, waving it over his head. &ldquo;Here you
are!&rdquo; he exclaimed, thrusting it into the hands of
the guide. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see what good that will
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never you mind, son,&rdquo; said the old man,
snatching the mirror from him. &ldquo;Jest you watch
my smoke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took up a position on the other side of Bert,
and manipulated the mirror so that a bright beam
of sunlight fell on the recumbent form. Its effect
was soon apparent. The poisonous insects stirred
uneasily, trying to avoid the glare that they hated.
Finding that there was no escaping it, they at last
commenced to crawl down in search of a more
shady resting place.</p>

<p>One by one they made off, the flashing ray of
light hastening the departure of the laggards.
Watching breathlessly, Dick and Tom waited for
the last noxious insect to crawl sluggishly down
onto the blanket and then off into the sand. Even
after the last one had been dislodged, the prairieman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
played the reflected sunlight over Bert until
there was no longer cause for apprehension.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, young fellers,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;I
cal&rsquo;late you can wake your friend up now without
takin&rsquo; any long chances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick and Tom were about to avail themselves
of this permission, but found that there was no
need. As they started forward the &ldquo;sleeper&rdquo; sat
up, and then scrambled to his feet.</p>

<p>His comrades uttered a simultaneous expression
of surprise, and Dick exclaimed, &ldquo;Of all the lucky
old reprobates that ever lived, Bert, you&rsquo;re certainly
the luckiest, without exception. If you had
waked up ten minutes sooner, you would&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Waked up your grandmother,&rdquo; interrupted
Bert. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve been awake over an hour. I
was awake when you got here, but I was afraid to
move for fear of having one of those things bite
me&mdash;ugh!&rdquo; and a great shudder of disgust passed
over him, &ldquo;that was a waking nightmare in earnest.
I feel as weak as a rag. Look at that!&rdquo; and he
held out his hand. It was trembling like a leaf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Waal, I&rsquo;ll be jiggered,&rdquo; exclaimed the Westerner,
in an admiring voice, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve sure got nerve,
young feller, and no mistake. It ain&rsquo;t everybody
as could hold hisself the way you did with them
blamed critters crawlin&rsquo; all over him. It took
nerve, it shore did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably you&rsquo;d have done the same thing if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
you&rsquo;d been in my place,&rdquo; observed Bert, with a
friendly smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Waal, mebbe I would an&rsquo; mebbe I wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
replied the old man, evidently much gratified by
this little compliment, &ldquo;although I don&rsquo;t say as how
I haven&rsquo;t had one or two close shaves in my time,
mind ye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, at any rate, I guess I owe my life to you,
and, of course, to my pals here,&rdquo; said Bert, &ldquo;and
all I can say is, that I&rsquo;m more than grateful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, young feller,&rdquo; replied the
plainsman, with a deprecatory wave of his hand,
&ldquo;you can thank me best by not sayin&rsquo; a word about
it. You&rsquo;d have done the same fer me ef you&rsquo;d
had the chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert said no more, but shook hands all around,
and then prepared to start on. &ldquo;You fellows lead
the way,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll follow. My appetite
is beginning to come back with a rush.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye&rsquo;d better follow the road we come by back
a piece,&rdquo; advised their guide, &ldquo;ye&rsquo;ll soon come to
the main road leadin&rsquo; into Boyd, and you oughtn&rsquo;t
to have any further trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That listens all right,&rdquo; observed Bert, and
Dick and Tom were of the same mind. Accordingly,
they lost no time in packing up Bert&rsquo;s luggage,
and soon had it stored neatly on the carrier.
Then Dick pointed the nose of the automobile in
the direction their guide had advised, Bert following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
at a little distance to give the dust raised by the
passage of the automobile time to settle. In a
short time they reached the road of which the
guide had spoken, and they spun along merrily.</p>

<p>They made a slight detour to set down the old
frontiersman, who had rendered them such invaluable
assistance. They parted from him with
great regret and many expressions of gratitude.
He stood in the sandy road waving his hat after
them until his figure became indistinct in the distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a friend in need, if there ever was
one,&rdquo; said Tom, and Dick was of the same opinion.</p>

<p>After awhile the road broadened out somewhat,
and Bert ranged up alongside the automobile. He
closed the muffler of his machine, and as it glided
along with scarcely a sound he and his friends conversed
without the slightest difficulty. In this way
the distance seemed nothing at all, and in due time
they drew into Boyd.</p>

<p>Bert left the &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo; at the garage, and
went with Tom and Dick to their hotel. They
were all ravenously hungry, and the ravages they
caused among the eatables filled the waiters with
astonishment. At last they had finished, and then
proceeded to discuss their future movements.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve managed to keep pretty well to schedule so
far,&rdquo; he told them, &ldquo;and some of the worst going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
is over. But, believe me, I wouldn&rsquo;t want to repeat
some of the experiences I&rsquo;ve had. Take this
morning, for instance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I shouldn&rsquo;t think you would,&rdquo; said Dick.
&ldquo;But tell us about a few. It won&rsquo;t do you any
harm to rest up an hour or two now, and we&rsquo;re
crazy to hear some of your adventures. Reel off
a few, like a good fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert gave them a brief review of his recent
movements, and they listened with the greatest interest.
Some of the incidents were very amusing,
but they elicited less laughter than they usually
would, for the nerves of all three had not yet fully
recovered from the shock they had received that
morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bert at last, rising, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, fellows,
but I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll have to be moving. Get
hold of that auto again, why don&rsquo;t you, and go
with me a little way. You can do that all right,
can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; exclaimed Dick. &ldquo;Bet your sweet life
we can,&rdquo; chimed in Tom, and so it was settled.</p>

<p>The three comrades proceeded directly to the
garage, and had no difficulty in hiring the car that
had already served them so well that morning.
Bert ran the &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo; out onto the sunlit
road, and, running beside it, shot on the spark.
The motor started immediately, and he gave a flying
leap into the saddle.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick and Tom were close behind, and tried to
catch up with him. But Bert would not have it
so. As soon as they began to get close he would
shoot ahead, and although they had a speedy car,
they realized that they stood no chance against
such a motorcycle as the &ldquo;Blue Streak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laughingly they gave over the attempt, and Bert
dropped back until they were abreast of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No chance, fellows,&rdquo; he called gaily. &ldquo;The
old &lsquo;Blue Streak&rsquo; and I don&rsquo;t take the dust of any
mere automobile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They exchanged jokes and friendly insults until
they had gone much further than they realized,
and were forced to turn back.</p>

<p>They stopped before parting and shook hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So long, old fellow,&rdquo; said Dick. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be
waiting to meet you at Oklahoma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; said Bert, wringing their hands,
&ldquo;see you later,&rdquo; and, leaping on the &ldquo;Blue Streak,&rdquo;
was soon lost to sight in a cloud of dust.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Day of Disaster</span></h3>


<p class="cap">After he left his companions, Bert made
good speed for a time, and hummed along
smoothly. At first all went well, and Bert was congratulating
himself on his good progress, when suddenly
his engine commenced racing wildly. In an
instant Bert had shut off power, and came to a stop
as soon as possible. Then he dismounted, and commenced
a hasty examination. The first thought
that flashed across his mind was that the clutch
had given way in some manner, thus allowing the
motor to slip. The clutch proved to be in perfect
condition, however, but a short further search revealed
the cause of the trouble.</p>

<p>The nut that held the engine driving sprocket
on the shaft had worked loose and dropped off.
Of course, the key that prevented the sprocket
from slipping on the shaft had dropped out soon
afterward, thus allowing the shaft to revolve without
transmitting the slightest power.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; thought Bert, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a pretty fix now,
for fair. Here I am thirty miles from the nearest
town and provided with a permanent free engine.
It rather looks as though I were up against it for
fair.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>He made a careful search among his spare parts,
but met with only partial success. He found a nut
that fitted the shaft fairly well, but nothing he
could substitute for the key.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps if I walk back a way I&rsquo;ll find it,&rdquo; he
thought, and accordingly he walked slowly back
the way he had come, carefully scanning every foot
of the path. He realized that the likelihood of finding
it was very slim, but there was always the
chance, so he hunted carefully. His efforts met
with no success, and at last he was forced to admit
to himself the hopelessness of the search.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve got to do something,&rdquo; he thought,
&ldquo;since I haven&rsquo;t got the part, I&rsquo;ll have to try and
make one, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; He reflected a few moments,
and then, seized with an idea, once more
looked through the tool bag. He selected the
smallest of his screwdrivers and a file, and began to
file away at the screwdriver about half an inch from
the end, intending to use it in place of the lost key.
But the steel of which it was composed was very
hard, and he found it a harder task than he had
anticipated.</p>

<p>At last, by dint of patient filing until his fingers
ached, he cut through the obstinate metal and finally
held the precious bit of steel between his fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he exclaimed, mopping his streaming
face, &ldquo;that was an awful job, but the end justifies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the means. I wouldn&rsquo;t swap this little bit of
steel now for ten times its weight in gold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tried it in the slot on the engine shaft, and
found it a fairly tight fit. &ldquo;Eureka!&rdquo; he exclaimed
aloud, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s bending circumstances to suit your
will, or I don&rsquo;t know what is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He quickly screwed on the holding nut, and once
more was ready to start. &ldquo;Come along now, old
fellow,&rdquo; he said, apostrophizing the &ldquo;Blue Streak,&rdquo;
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got to do double work now to make up for
this delay. Speed&rsquo;s the word from now on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Misfortune after misfortune overtook him, however,
and he was delayed again and again. It almost
seemed as though fate repented of having
saved him from a horrible death that morning,
and was resolved to make up for her leniency by
imposing unusual hardships on the devoted motorcyclist.</p>

<p>He had not gone more than ten miles from
where he had made the new shaft key when the
long driving chain snapped. Of course, he had
extra links with him, and repaired it quickly, but
even then much valuable time was lost. Then, he
had hardly started again before a weak place in
the front tire gave way with a report like that of
a pistol shot, and he was forced to put in a new
tube and a repair patch.</p>

<p>This done, he chugged on some time without
further mishap, and was just beginning to believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
that his troubles were over, when suddenly he was
apprised by the hard jarring of the back wheel
that the tire on it had gone flat. This meant another
half hour&rsquo;s delay, and Bert began to feel
that he was &ldquo;hoodooed&rdquo; in earnest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what will happen next,&rdquo; he thought,
as he started off, after remedying the last misfortune.
&ldquo;Hard luck seems to be keeping me company,
and that isn&rsquo;t the best kind of a road companion
to have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But for the present his fears remained unrealized,
and as the road continued fairly good he
raced along, mounting up the miles on his speedometer
in a very satisfactory fashion. He made
good time, and only stopped when the pangs of
hunger warned him that it was lunch time.</p>

<p>Tom and Dick had taken care to see that he was
provided with plenty of wholesome &ldquo;grub,&rdquo; and
had personally supervised the putting up of the
lunch by the good-natured hotel chef.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They certainly made a good job of it,&rdquo; thought
he appreciatively, as he partook of delicious fried
chicken sandwiches and crisp brown crullers. He
washed down the meal with a long pull from his
canteen, and then, after allowing himself a few
minutes of hard-earned rest, was off again toward
the goal that now began to seem less distant than
it had before.</p>

<p>But the &ldquo;jinx&rdquo; had not yet deserted him, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
was soon to discover. As he was bowling along at
a pace well over thirty miles an hour, he suddenly
turned a sharp bend in the road and ran squarely
into a deep bed of sand. Before he could slow
down appreciably, he was in it&mdash;and, a second
later, was in it literally. All his skill and strength
could not keep the machine from skidding, and he
experienced a bone-racking fall.</p>

<p>In a second he had picked himself up, and ran
to where the &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo; was lying, its motor
still plugging away and the rear wheel sending
showers of sand into the air. Bert shut off the
power and proceeded to take stock of damages.
The footboard on the right had struck through the
sand to the hard gravel below and had broken one
of its supports. This weakened it so much that
Bert found it would not bear his weight.</p>

<p>There was nothing for him to do but repair the
damage as best he could, and at length he managed
to make a temporary repair with a spool of
copper wire and a pair of pliers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is getting serious,&rdquo; thought Bert ruefully,
as he finished the job. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never get anywhere if
this keeps up long. But perhaps it&rsquo;s better to have
everything come at once and get it over with. I
might as well look at the bright side of it, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He started off finally, and now it seemed that
at last he was to go forward without interruption.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
But unfortunately, he was to find that this view of
the case was altogether too sanguine. The road
grew continually worse, and it became impossible
to make even average speed. In places it was very
sandy, too, and this hindered him a good deal.</p>

<p>His trusty mount stood the bumping and
wrenching it received without the slightest sign of
weakening, and Bert was grateful indeed for the
staunch construction that made its present satisfactory
performance possible.</p>

<p>The road was deeply rutted, and it was only by
the most careful managing that he steered clear of
the depressions. But nothing could stop him, and
he plugged doggedly on. The &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo;
slipped and skidded, and tried to &ldquo;lie down and
roll over,&rdquo; as he described it afterward, and the
strain on his wrists and arms was tremendous. If
the handlebars had once gotten out of his control
they would have zigzagged wildly and the result
would have been a bad fall. This Bert did his
best to avoid, as he was already bruised by the
spills he had been through.</p>

<p>At times he was forced to stop and rest a few
minutes, and he always made use of these breathing
spells to let the old oil out of his motor and pump
in a fresh supply. Then when he resumed his
journey the motor would be like a different piece
of mechanism. It almost seemed as though it, too,
became weary at times and benefited by a brief rest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Probably every experienced motorist has noticed
this, and many theories have been advanced in explanation,
but none of them seem very satisfactory.
Bert by this time was beginning to feel the effects
of the strain he had endured all through the day.
He plowed slowly through the clinging sand, traveling
most of the time on low gear. This was not
the best thing in the world for his engine, and
every once in a while he was forced to stop and let
it cool. With the engine turning over so fast he
had to use an excessive supply of oil, and at length
was warned, by the sucking sound of the oil pump,
that the tank was empty.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, before he left Boyd he
had secured an extra half gallon can of lubricating
oil, which he had strapped on the luggage carrier.
&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s a mighty lucky thing I did, too,&rdquo; he
thought, &ldquo;otherwise I&rsquo;d be stalled for good, with
the prospect of a long tramp to the nearest town.
But now I can still beat the game.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He unstrapped the can, and emptied its contents
into the oil tank. &ldquo;That ought to last me until
I reach some place where I can get more,&rdquo; he
thought, throwing the empty can away. &ldquo;Here
goes to buck this sand like a rotary plow going
through a snow bank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave the motor a couple of pump fulls of
oil, and started it going. Slipping in the clutch, he
moved forward with the grim resolve to take long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
chances for the sake of gaining ground. Gradually
he opened the throttle, and when he had attained
a good speed, changed to high gear. The
&ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo; gained momentum and charged
ahead, throwing showers of sand into the air.
Every muscle tense, Bert held the motorcycle on
the trail, despite the strong inclination it evinced
to go off on little exploring expeditions of its own.
He reeled off mile after mile at a good clip, and
began to feel better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This might be a lot worse,&rdquo; thought Bert, &ldquo;if
nothing happens now, I&rsquo;ll have made pretty fair
progress by supper time.&rdquo; Consulting his speedometer
he found that he had covered something
over a hundred and twenty miles so far, which,
considering all the delays he had been subjected
to, and the bad roads, was very fair progress.</p>

<p>But even as this thought was passing through
his mind, the front wheel caught in a hollow, the
handlebars were wrenched from his hands with a
force that almost broke his wrists, and he was
flying through the air. He landed with a crash,
and for a few moments, dazzling lights glittered
before his eyes. Gradually these cleared away, and
he sat up, feeling very dizzy and sick.</p>

<p>As his head cleared, he staggered to his feet,
and looked around for his motorcycle. There it
lay, at some distance, half buried in the sand. He
went over to it, and, after scooping some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
sand away, succeeded by a great effort in pulling it
upright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess my part of the race is finished right
here,&rdquo; he thought, with a sinking heart. &ldquo;Something
<i>must</i> have been badly broken in a fall like
that. It&rsquo;s a wonder I wasn&rsquo;t killed myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He set the &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo; up on its stand, and
cranked the engine. It gave a few spasmodic explosions,
but then stopped. &ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; he exclaimed
aloud, with a feeling nearly akin to despair.
But his indomitable spirit was not yet ready to give
up hope, and he commenced a careful examination
of his mount.</p>

<p>The handlebars were slewed around until they
stood at right angles to the machine. But this was
a minor thing, and with the aid of a wrench he
soon set matters right. The main thing was to locate
the cause of the motor refusing to run, and
he set himself to solve the problem, as he had so
many others in the course of this most eventful
and unlucky day.</p>

<p>He tested the magneto spark by kicking the
motor over energetically, and holding the conduction
cable a quarter of an inch or so from the cylinders.
A hot blue spark jumped snapping across
the gap, and Bert drew a sigh of relief. Provided
the magneto were all right, he felt that he might
get started again after all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The trouble must be in the carburetor,&rdquo; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
concluded, and forthwith proceeded to dissect that
highly important part of his equipment. His suspicions
proved well founded. The carburetor was
packed with sand, which had worked up into the
spray plug and completely blocked the fine grooves
cut in it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy,&rdquo; thought Bert. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just wash this
out in a little less than no time, and then I hope
everything will be all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He washed gasoline through the carburetor, and
cleaned the spray plug till not a vestige of sand
remained. He then quickly assembled the instrument
and connected it up with the induction pipes.
Flooding the carburetor with gasoline, he gave the
engine a quick turn over. Immediately it started
off with a roar, and Bert threw the wrench he had
been using into the air, and deftly caught it again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;now, old boy, we&rsquo;ll try it
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He still felt rather dizzy, but the sun was getting
low, and he knew he would have to &ldquo;go some&rdquo;
to reach the next town before dark. He hastily
put his tools away, and in a short time was speeding
along again, nothing daunted by the accident.
Presently the road improved, a sure sign that he
was approaching a settlement. Soon he could make
out the low houses of the little prairie town before
him and he increased his speed, &ldquo;splitting the air&rdquo;
like a comet.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>He reached the village without further trouble,
and was soon solacing himself for the strenuous
day he had gone through with the best dinner the
resources of the town could provide.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Flaming Forest</span></h3>


<p class="cap">Early on the morning of the eighth day of
the trip, Bert crossed the line into Oklahoma.
He found little difference in the roads he encountered,
most of them being of a very poor description.
But by this time he was used to all sorts of
going, and could listen without laughing, when one
of the natives, in a fit of enthusiasm, would speak
of some atrocious path as a &ldquo;highway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course, in isolated instances some village or
town had inaugurated a &ldquo;good roads&rdquo; movement,
and then Bert found nothing to complain of. But
as a rule the roads were inferior, and he found
fast travel practically impossible.</p>

<p>He rode steadily, however, and by noon had
made fairly good progress. He now found himself
in a thickly wooded country, and rode mile
after mile in a deep shade that was very grateful
after some of the blistering hours in the open he
had been forced to undergo. There was a brisk
breeze blowing, and the leaves rustled pleasantly,
allowing slender shafts of sunlight to flicker
through them as they swayed and whispered.</p>

<p>Bert drew in great breaths of the fragrant air,
redolent of a thousand woody odors, and wished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
that the whole of his journey lay through such
pleasant places. After a while he came to a beautiful
little glen through which ran a sparkling brook.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just the place to eat lunch,&rdquo; thought Bert, and
quickly brought the &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo; to a standstill.
Dismounting, he unpacked his lunch box, and, sitting
down on a broad, flat-topped rock at the edge
of the stream, ate contentedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This place is a regular little Garden of Eden,&rdquo;
he mused. &ldquo;There must be fish in that stream. If
I only had a hook and line along, I&rsquo;ll wager I&rsquo;d
get some sport out of it.&rdquo; Then another thought
struck him. &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he exclaimed aloud, &ldquo;a
swim would feel mighty good now, and there must
be a place deep enough for one somewhere around
here. I&rsquo;m going on an exploring expedition, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sure enough, around a slight bend in the stream
he discovered a pool that almost looked as though
it had been made to order. A gigantic tree had
fallen across the stream, forming a natural dam.
The clear water ran over and under it with a tinkling,
splashing sound, and Bert gave a shout of
joy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here goes for a glorious swim,&rdquo; he cried, and,
undressing hastily, plunged in. The water was icy
cold, and for a moment the shock of it took away
his breath and made his heart stand still. But in
a few seconds the reaction came, and he splashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
around, and even managed to swim a few strokes
in the deepest part.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is great,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have
missed it for worlds. It&rsquo;s too bad the old &lsquo;Blue
Streak&rsquo; can&rsquo;t enjoy it with me.&rdquo; He smiled as this
absurd thought crossed his mind, but little knew
how much of prophecy there was in it.</p>

<p>When he felt thoroughly refreshed, he climbed
out to the bank, and quickly slipped into his
clothes. &ldquo;I can dry out as I go along,&rdquo; he thought,
with a grin. &ldquo;Somebody evidently forgot to hang
bath towels on these trees. Very careless of them,
<i>I</i> think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hurried back to where he had left the motorcycle,
and soon was once more purring along the
woodland track. He had traveled something less
than an hour, when he began to notice a thin blue
haze in the air, and at the same time to smell a
pungent smoke. His first thought was that he was
near some settler&rsquo;s cabin, but as he rode on he
could see no sign of human habitation, and the
green forest stretched away on both sides of the
road without any break that might denote a trail.</p>

<p>But the smoke kept getting heavier every second,
and suddenly the truth smote him like a blow
in the face. &ldquo;A forest fire,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;a forest
fire! and here I am, in the heart of these woods,
with absolutely no way of escape, that I can see.&rdquo;
Even as these thoughts flashed through his mind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
a rabbit dashed out onto the road, so mad with
terror that it almost ran under the wheels of the
motorcycle.</p>

<p>Bert brought his machine to a standstill with a
jerk, the back tire skidding as he jammed on his
brake. A thousand plans raced through his head,
only to be rejected as soon as formed. Of them
all only one offered the slightest hope of escape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The brook,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;if I can only get back
there I&rsquo;ll have a chance to pull through. If the
fire beats me to it&mdash;well, there will be one less contestant
in this race, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He lifted the motorcycle bodily from the
ground, in his excitement and dire need, handling
it as easily as he would a bicycle, pointing it back
the way he had so lately come. Then, with a shove
and a leap he was off on a wild ride, with life itself
as the prize.</p>

<p>He flew swiftly along the narrow trail, careless
of ruts and obstructions that he had avoided with
the greatest care but a short time before. The
smoke grew thick and choking, reddening his eyes,
irritating his lungs. It was only by the greatest
good fortune that he avoided a collision with the
panic-stricken animals that dashed across the road
in great numbers, disappearing among the underbrush
on the other side. Now he could hear a distant
roaring and crackling, and great waves of heat
billowed down upon him. He clenched his teeth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and opened the throttle to the utmost. The woods
streaked away on both sides, and soon he saw that
he was nearing his goal.</p>

<p>But the fire was traveling fast as well as he, and
he could see it leaping through the tops of the
trees at no great distance. The heat scorched and
burned him, and the motorcycle felt hot to the
touch. But, after what seemed an interminable
time, he reached the brook, which now offered the
last chance of safety.</p>

<p>Scarcely checking his speed, Bert swung off the
road. His machine skidded wildly, but the tires
gripped in time, and Bert steered for the deep pool
in which he had bathed less than two hours ago.
The &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo; crashed through the underbrush,
beating down all opposition by its terrific
momentum, the powerful motor forcing it forward
like a battering ram. Bert gripped the tank with
his knees, and held on grimly, checking his mount
at last at the brink of the pool.</p>

<p>By now, the heat was almost intolerable, but
there was still something left for him to do before
he could plunge into the cool water. Way back in
his camping days he had learned the best way of
fighting a forest fire, and now he put his knowledge
to account. He applied a light to the grass
and underbrush bordering the pool, and a thin line
of flame began creeping to meet the furious conflagration
dashing through the trees. This would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
leave a narrow belt of charred land around the
pool that would hold the fire at a little distance, at
least.</p>

<p>This done, Bert seized the handlebars of his
motorcycle, and hauled it into the pool after him,
until it was partly immersed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best I can do for you, old friend,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;I guess the fire can&rsquo;t reach you there,
at any rate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he waded in until he reached the deepest
part of the pool, and waited for the advance of the
devouring element.</p>

<p>He had plenty of company, as rabbits, foxes,
and numerous other wild creatures continually
plunged into the water, their eyes wide with terror,
and all thoughts of age-old enmities wiped
from their minds.</p>

<p>The heat grew more intense every moment, and
Bert felt the skin on his face blistering. He took
a long breath, and ducked his head completely under
water. He kept it there until it seemed as
though his lungs would burst for lack of air, and
then lifted it to take another breath. In those few
seconds the fire had made tremendous strides, and
now met the backfire that Bert had started. He
had only time to take a hasty glimpse of all this,
and then was forced to duck under again. Every
breath he drew was hot as the blast of a furnace,
and seemed fairly to scorch his lungs.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>The fire burned for a few minutes with no appreciable
lessening of its fury, but then, deprived of
fuel, gradually passed by on each side of the pool.
Its terrific roaring slowly died away in the distance,
and the unbearable heat abated somewhat,
although smoke still hung in a heavy pall over the
blackened ground.</p>

<p>At last Bert found he could venture from the
water with safety, and accordingly did so. At the
same time the wild creatures who had sought refuge
in the same place bethought themselves of engagements
elsewhere, and scampered off.</p>

<p>Bert hauled the &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo; out of the water,
and found it practically unharmed. Some of the
enamel had blistered, but Bert paid little attention
to this, so long as the machine was still in running
order. He had taken care not to let the water
touch the magneto, and so was able to start immediately.</p>

<p>As he rode over the blackened trail, Bert could
not help comparing the scene of desolation that
now met his eye with the beautiful appearance the
woods had presented so short a time before. In
places the ground still smoked and smouldered, and
in others trees burned like giant torches.</p>

<p>But Bert realized that he had had a narrow
escape from death, and this thought kept him from
dwelling too long on the devastated landscape.
After two or three hours&rsquo; riding, he passed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
fire belt, and once more entered a flourishing forest.
He made steady progress, and before nightfall
reached a fair-sized town. Most of the able-bodied
men had not returned from fighting the fire, and at
first the few who were left would hardly believe
Bert&rsquo;s account of his escape. But a look at the
blistered enamel on the motorcycle convinced them,
and they united in congratulating him on his good
fortune. As one grizzled old fellow remarked,
&ldquo;Thar ain&rsquo;t many folks as can say they&rsquo;ve come
through a forest fire as easy as you did, son. Thar
generally ain&rsquo;t much o&rsquo; them left to tell the story.&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Racing an Airship</span></h3>


<p class="cap">It was a hot, oppressive day when Bert set out
from Ralston. But he had had a restful sleep,
and felt in fine trim for anything. He had eaten
a hearty breakfast, and this no doubt added to his
feeling of buoyancy and satisfaction with life in
general. In addition, his mount was acting beautifully,
purring along with the deep-throated exhaust
that tells its own story of fine adjustments and perfect
carburetion.</p>

<p>The country through which he traveled was very
flat, and for mile after mile he glided easily along,
encountering no obstructions worthy of the name.
The road was smooth, and, contrary to the general
run of roads in this section, comparatively free
from sand and dust. The fresh, invigorating air
added to his feeling of exhilaration, and he was
tempted to &ldquo;open &rsquo;er up&rdquo; and do a little speeding.</p>

<p>He had about decided to do so, when suddenly
he became conscious of hearing some noise not proceeding
from his machine.</p>

<p>At first he thought it must be an automobile
coming up back of him, but, as he glanced over his
shoulder, he could see no sign of one, although the
road stretched out for miles without a break.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Instantly his mind grasped the significance of the
sound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be an aeroplane,&rdquo; he thought, and,
glancing upward, was not much surprised to see
one outlined against the clear blue of the sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; thought Bert, &ldquo;this is an unexpected
pleasure. I didn&rsquo;t know there was an aeroplane
within two hundred miles of here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The aeroplane, which proved to be of the biplane
type, was evidently descending. At first,
Bert had stopped to get a good look at it, but then,
feeling that he had no time to lose, had remounted
and resumed his journey.</p>

<p>But as he went along, he knew that the &rsquo;plane
was still descending because of the increasing noise
of its exhaust. In the same way he could tell that
the machine was overtaking him, but at first the
thought of trying to beat it never entered his head.
Even in all his varied and exciting adventures he
had never had a brush with such an adversary.</p>

<p>In an incredibly short time, however, the aeroplane
was directly over his head, and he glanced
upward. As he did so, the aviator leaned forward
slightly, and waved his gloved hand. Bert waved
in reply, and then the airman made a gesture which
Bert interpreted, and rightly, as being a challenge.</p>

<p>Needless to say, our hero was not one to decline
such an invitation, and accordingly he opened his
throttle a little. Instantly his exhaust changed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
from its deep grumble to a harsh bark, and his
machine leaped forward.</p>

<p>In answer to this, the aviator fed more gas to
<i>his</i> motor, and his graceful machine soared forward
in advance of Bert and the &ldquo;Blue Streak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; thought Bert, &ldquo;this will never do,&rdquo; and
he gave his powerful machine more throttle, at the
same time advancing the spark to the limit. That
last fraction of an inch of spark sent his machine
surging ahead like some wild thing let loose, and
he leaned far down to escape the terrific resistance
caused by the wind. The road streamed away behind
him, and he had a thrill of exultation as he
felt his machine leap forward in response to the
slightest touch of the throttle.</p>

<p>His adversary in the air was not to be easily outdistanced,
however, and he kept up with Bert, refusing
to be shaken off.</p>

<p>Bert felt that now was the time to take the lead,
if possible, and accordingly he opened the throttle
almost to the limit, although he still held something
in reserve.</p>

<p>The powerful motor responded nobly, and the
machine skimmed over the sun-baked road at a
terrific pace. The bird-man did his best to squeeze
a little more speed out of his whirling motor, but
was unable to cope with the rushing, roaring little
speck down below him. At last he was forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
to a realization of this, and abruptly cut down his
speed.</p>

<p>Bert continued his headlong flight for a short
time, but finding that the aeroplane did not pass
him, concluded that it must have fallen behind.
Accordingly, he slackened his own speed, but very
gradually, for he was too wise to risk disaster by
slowing down too suddenly.</p>

<p>Soon his speed had abated sufficiently to allow
the use of the brakes, and he brought his machine
to a standstill. Lifting it onto its stand, he pushed
his goggles up on his forehead, and looked around
for his late rival.</p>

<p>He made out the aeroplane at no great distance,
and could see that it was making preparations to
land. When the aviator reached a point almost
over Bert&rsquo;s head, he shut off his engine entirely,
and, describing a great spiral, landed gently on the
ground not a hundred yards from where Bert and
the &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo; were standing.</p>

<p>Bert immediately ran toward him, and the aviator
stepped stiffly from his seat and held out his
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a mighty fast machine there, comrade,&rdquo;
he said, with a grin, as Bert shook hands
with him. &ldquo;I thought my &rsquo;plane was pretty good,
but I guess your motor bike is better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it isn&rsquo;t so bad, perhaps,&rdquo; replied Bert,
unable no matter how hard he tried, to <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>keep a little
note of pride out of his voice. &ldquo;I manage to get
a little action out of it once in a while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say you did,&rdquo; agreed his late rival,
&ldquo;but what are you doing way out here a thousand
miles from nowhere, more or less?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might ask the same question of you,&rdquo; replied
Bert, with a smile, &ldquo;but as you beat me to it, I&rsquo;ll
answer yours first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert then proceeded to outline briefly the contest
in which he was engaged, but, before he had
gone far, his companion interrupted him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know all about that!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;And so you&rsquo;re one of the chaps in the transcontinental
race, are you? Well, you haven&rsquo;t got so
much further to go, considering the distance you&rsquo;ve
covered already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I guess the worst of it is over,&rdquo; agreed
Bert, &ldquo;although I&rsquo;ve been told that there are some
very bad roads ahead of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, there are,&rdquo; replied the aviator,
&ldquo;and that&rsquo;s where I have an advantage over you.
I don&rsquo;t have to worry over road conditions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert saw that he was a little chagrined over his
defeat, and so forebore to argue the merits of
motorcycle versus airship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just the same,&rdquo; he thought to himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a
whole lot more likely to get where I want to go
than he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he and his new-found companion fell into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
a discussion regarding various types of motors, and
inspected each other&rsquo;s machines with interest. By
the time this was over it was high noon, and Bert
proposed that they eat lunch together.</p>

<p>The aviator agreed heartily to this, and accordingly
they unpacked their lunches and, sitting in
the shade of one of the aeroplane wings, made a
hearty meal.</p>

<p>When the last crumb had been disposed of, they
shook hands with expressions of mutual regard,
and the aviator was very cordial in wishing Bert
all kinds of success in the contest. Then they said
good-bye, and resumed their respective journeys.
Bert watched the airship ascend in great spirals,
until it was a mere speck in the distance, winging
rapidly eastward.</p>

<p>Before starting, Bert looked over his machine
carefully, in order to assure himself that nothing
had been loosened by the vibration caused by the
high speed. Everything seemed in perfect shape,
and in less time than it takes to tell he was &ldquo;eating
up space&rdquo; in a fashion that promised to land him
speedily at his destination.</p>

<p>But before he had gone many miles, he found
the road, which up to now had been exceptionally
good, becoming more and more sandy, and he was
forced to go slowly and pick his way very carefully.
As the sand grew deeper his machine evinced
a very decided tendency to skid, and he was forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
to exert all his strength to keep the front wheel
pointed straight ahead.</p>

<p>Soon he shifted to low gear, and crawled forward
at a pace little faster than a brisk walk. He
now had reason, as indeed he had a score of times
so far, to bless the foresight that had led him to
purchase a two-speed machine. Without this, he
felt that the accomplishment of his task would be
well-nigh hopeless.</p>

<p>The heat became more and more oppressive, and
the alkali dust on his face smarted and blistered.
At intervals he would dismount, take a drink from
his canteen, and give his motor a chance to cool off.</p>

<p>Then he would start on again, resolved to reach
the next town before nightfall. What with the
many interruptions and the slow pace, however,
darkness overtook him while yet he was more than
ten miles from his destination.</p>

<p>Dismounting, he lighted his lamp, and once more
took up the forward flight. The air, from being
excessively hot, now became quite the opposite, and
he felt chilled to the bone. He kept doggedly
on, nevertheless, and at last his perseverance was
rewarded by his catching a glimpse of the lights
of the town for which he was bound. At the same
time the road became much better, and he covered
the intervening mile or two at good speed.</p>

<p>The town was not a large one, but it could afford
a square meal and a good bed, and that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
all that Bert asked for. He had a hard time to
tear himself away from the other guests, who were
very much interested in his adventures, and plied
him with innumerable questions.</p>

<p>At last he managed to say good-night, and fifteen
minutes afterward was sunk in the deep,
dreamless sleep of utter but healthy exhaustion.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">An Unseen Listener</span></h3>


<p class="cap">Bert was lost. There was no use blinking the
fact. For two hours past this feeling had been
growing stronger, and now it had deepened into
a conviction.</p>

<p>It was an unusual and disconcerting experience
for him. His sense of location was very keen and
acute, and, even without a compass, he had been
able almost instinctively to distinguish the cardinal
points. But just now he was deprived of the help
of that trusty counselor. He had been compelled
to dismount, a little while since, to make some
trifling adjustment. Some time later, when the
sun had disappeared under a cloud, he felt in the
pocket where he usually carried his compass, and
was dismayed to find it empty. He must have lost
it in bending over the machine. He could replace
it when he reached the next large town, but just at
present he missed it sorely. For an hour now, the
sun had been invisible, and although he felt confident
he was traveling due West, he would have
given a good deal for absolute assurance of that
fact.</p>

<p>If he had been following some broad highway,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
he would not so much have cared, as he would have
been sure before long to reach some settlement
where he could again get his bearings. But there
had been a number of trails, none of them well-defined,
and he had chosen one that grew fainter
and fainter as he progressed until it had faded
away into the mass of the prairie. In bright sunlight,
he might have still been able to trace it, but,
in the dun haze and gathering dusk, it was no
longer visible.</p>

<p>Although the country was mostly a level plain,
it was interspersed here and there with bits of
woodland and rocky buttes, rising in places to a
height of two hundred feet. One of these Bert
descried in the distance, and, putting on more
power, he neared it rapidly. If he had to spend
the night in the open, which seemed very probable
now, he wanted to have the cheer and comfort of
a fire, and there was no material for that in the
treeless plain. At the edge of the wood he could
get boughs and branches. By the aid of the spirit
lamp that he carried in his kit, he could make a pot
of coffee to supplement the sandwiches he had with
him.</p>

<p>By the time he had reached the woods it had
grown wholly dark. He jumped from the saddle,
leaned the &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo; against a tree, and commenced
to gather twigs and branches. He soon
had enough for his purpose, and was just about to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
apply a match, when he caught the twinkle of a
light, farther up the wooded slope. He looked
closely and could see the outlines of a cabin from
which the light was streaming.</p>

<p>The discovery was both a surprise and a delight.
Here was human companionship, and an opportunity
to know just where he was and how he could
best reach the nearest town. He thought it was
probably the hut of some sheepherder or cattleman,
and he had no doubt of a warm welcome.
Apart from the hospitality that is proverbial on
the Western plains, the occupant of that lonely
cabin would be just as glad as himself to have a
companion for the night. He thrust his matchbox
back in its waterproof pouch, and, taking his machine
by the handlebars, began to trundle it up the
slope.</p>

<p>His first impulse was to blow the horn of his
motorcycle, as a cheery announcement that a
stranger was coming. But as he reached out his
hand, some unseen power seemed to hold him back.
There seemed to be no reason for the caution, but
that subtle &ldquo;sixth sense,&rdquo; that experience had
taught Bert to rely upon, asserted itself. On such
occasions he had learned not to argue, but to obey.
He did so now, and, instead of going directly to the
cabin as he had planned at first, made a wide circle
and came up behind. He left the motorcycle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
fifty feet away, and then with infinite care drew
near the cabin.</p>

<p>It was a rude structure of logs, and mud had
been used to close up the chinks. There was no
window on that side, but in several places the dried
mud had fallen away, and the light shone through
the crevices. Bert glued his eye to the largest of
these openings and looked in.</p>

<p>A smoky lamp stood on a rough pine table, before
which a man was seated on a nail keg. His
face was partly turned away, and, at the moment
Bert saw him, he was applying his lips to a half-filled
whiskey bottle. He took an enormous dram
and then slammed the bottle down on the table and
drew his sleeve across his mouth.</p>

<p>Around his waist was a cartridge belt, and two
ugly-looking revolvers peeped from his holsters.
A bowie knife lay on the table beside the lamp.
The outlook was not reassuring, and Bert blessed
the caution that had impelled him to &ldquo;hasten
slowly&rdquo; in approaching the cabin.</p>

<p>He blessed it again when the man with an oath
and a snarl picked up a handbill that had dropped
on the floor. In doing so, he exposed his full face
to view, and Bert thought that he had seldom seen
one so wholly villainous.</p>

<p>The ferret-like eyes, set close together, as they
looked out from beneath bushy brows, glinted with
ferocity. Although comparatively young, dissipation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and reckless living had stamped their impress
on every feature. His outthrust jaw bespoke a
bulldog courage and determination. Brute was written
largely all over him. An ugly scar across his
temple told of the zip of a bullet or the crease of
a knife. It was the face of a desperado who would
stop at nothing, however murderous or cruel, to
gain his ends.</p>

<p>As the light fell upon the paper, Bert saw that
it was headed by the word &ldquo;REWARD&rdquo; in staring
capitals. Then came a picture that corresponded
closely to the face of the man who was reading.
Large print followed, of which Bert could see
enough to grasp the meaning. It was an offer of
five thousand dollars reward for the capture, alive
or dead, of &ldquo;Billy the Kid,&rdquo; who had held up a
stage at Valley Gulch two weeks before, and, after
killing the driver and one of the passengers who
had resisted, had made his escape with the contents
of the express company&rsquo;s pouch.</p>

<p>Billy the Kid! The newspapers had been full of
the robbery at the time it was committed, and columns
had been published narrating his exploits.
He was wanted for thefts and murders covering a
series of years. Posses were out for him in all directions,
but he seemed to bear a charmed life and
had successfully evaded capture. An almost superstitious
fear attached to his name, and he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
cited as an illustrious example of the &ldquo;Devil taking
care of his own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dead or alive,&rdquo; muttered the outlaw with an
ugly sneer. &ldquo;It will have to be dead, then. They&rsquo;ll
never get me alive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert was in a ticklish situation. The slightest
move on his part might betray his presence to this
sullen bandit, to whom human life was nothing.
He slipped his hand behind him and was comforted
by the feel of his revolver. It was a Colt .45, fully
loaded, and he knew how to use it. In that fight
with the pirates off the Chinese coast it had done
good service. He knew that, at need, he could
rely upon it now. He took it from his hip pocket
and put it in his breast, with the handle protruding
so that he could grasp it instantly.</p>

<p>Just then the gallop of horses smote upon his
ears. The outlaw heard it, too, and jumped to
his feet. He blew out the light and snatched up
his weapons. The hoof beats drew nearer and a
halloo rang out that was evidently a preconcerted
signal. With an oath of relief the desperado relighted
the lamp and went to the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time you came,&rdquo; he ripped out savagely.
&ldquo;What kept you so long?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t help it, Cap,&rdquo; protested a man who entered
the cabin, closely followed by four others.
&ldquo;Manuel had to hang around the telegraph office
till the message came from Red Pete. The minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
it came, we beat it lickety split and almost killed
our hosses getting here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The leader snatched the held out telegram and
read it eagerly while the five men, of the same
desperate type as their captain, stood around ready
to jump at his bidding. It was clear that they
feared and cringed to him. His brute force and
superior cunning combined with his evil reputation
held them in complete subjection.</p>

<p>The telegram was brief and seemingly innocent:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mary leaves at ten. Meet her with carriage.
Pleasant visit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew from his pocket a scrap of paper, evidently
containing a key to the message. He compared
it with the telegram, and a light of unholy
glee came into his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, boys,&rdquo; he said, his fierce demeanor
softening somewhat. &ldquo;The Overland
Limited will be at the water tank near Dorsey at
three o&rsquo;clock. There&rsquo;ll be forty thousand in the
express messenger&rsquo;s safe. It&rsquo;s up to us to make a
rich haul and a quick getaway. Now listen to
me,&rdquo; and with the swift decision that marks the
born leader and that went far to explain his ascendancy
over his men, he sketched out the plan of the
coming robbery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, Mike and Manuel, will attend to the
engineer and fireman. First get their hands up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
over their heads. Then keep them covered and
make them uncouple the engine and express car
from the rest of the train and run up the track a
half a mile or so. I&rsquo;ll see to the express messenger
myself. He&rsquo;ll open that safe or I&rsquo;ll blow his head
off and then break open the safe with dynamite.
Joe and Bob and Ed will stay by the train and keep
shooting off their guns, to cow the passengers and
trainmen while we get in our work. We won&rsquo;t
have time to go through the cars, as it will be too
near daylight, and we&rsquo;ll have to do some hard riding
while it&rsquo;s dark. I hate to let the passengers&rsquo;
coin and jewelry go, but we&rsquo;ll get enough from the
express car to make up for that. Let your horses
rest till twelve and then we&rsquo;ll saddle up and get to
the water tank by two. Now you fellows know
what you&rsquo;ve got to do, and God help the man who
makes a bad break. He&rsquo;ll have to reckon with
me,&rdquo; and he laid his hand significantly on the handle
of his knife.</p>

<p>There was an uneasy grin on the part of the
men, and then they fell to discussing the details
of the plan, while the bottle passed freely from
hand to hand.</p>

<p>Bert, who had listened breathlessly to the daring
plot, was doing some rapid thinking. He had not
the slightest idea where the water tank was located.
It might be east, west, north or south, as
far as he knew. But what he did know was that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
it behooved him to get away from that dangerous
locality at the earliest possible moment. His life
would not have been worth much if he had been
discovered before they had discussed the robbery.
Now that he was in possession of the details, it
would be worth absolutely nothing. A killing more
or less made no difference to these abandoned outlaws,
and they would have shot him with as little
concern as they would a prairie dog.</p>

<p>Then, too, the alarm ought to be given at once.
By riding into the night, he would have a chance
of reaching some town and getting into touch with
the railroad authorities, by wire or phone. Or he
might run across some one familiar with the country
who could guide him. Anything was better
than inaction. Theft and murder were in the air,
and every passing moment made them more probable.
He might break his neck, collide with a rock
or a tree, ride over a precipice in the dark. But
he had to take a chance. Danger had never yet
turned him from the path of duty. It should not
daunt him now.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Outlaw Plot</span></h3>


<p class="cap">Slowly, carefully, hardly venturing to
breathe, he backed away from the cabin. He
got outside the zone of light and felt for his motorcycle.
With the utmost caution not to touch the
horn or siren, he guided it in a wide semicircle
down the slope. One of the horses whinnied as he
passed and an outlaw appeared at the door. After
listening for a moment, while Bert stood like a
stone image in his track, the man, evidently satisfied,
turned and went inside.</p>

<p>Then Bert moved on again by inches until he
reached the edge of the woods. From there he
knew that the faint click made by the valves in
starting could not possibly be heard from above.
He drew a long breath and for the first time turned
his gaze toward the sky. He was rejoiced to find
that the clouds had vanished and that the deep blue
was sown with stars. He needed no compass now.
There was the gleaming Polar Star by which he had
often guided his course as unerringly as by the sun.
He paused a moment to get a direction due west.
Then he leaped into the saddle and was off.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Not until he was sure that he was beyond the
sight of any possible watcher from the cabin, did
he dismount and light his lamp. Then with the
confidence that came from the light streaming far
ahead of him, he threw in the clutch and let his
machine out to the limit.</p>

<p>He had ridden perhaps twenty miles, looking
anxiously about for the lights of a town, when at
some distance he saw the flames from a campfire
in the lee of a bluff far away to his right. He
could see a group of men, some moving about,
others stretched out near the fire apparently asleep.
Mindful of his previous experience, he put out his
light and glided toward them like a shrouded
ghost.</p>

<p>Stopping outside the circle of light, where he
could study the scene at his leisure, he counted a
dozen men. They were strapping fellows, rough
in dress and appearance, but with honest, fearless
faces. One of them wore a badge that stamped
him as an official of some kind, and he was evidently
in command of the party. Bert hesitated
no longer, but, mounting, rode slowly into the
firelight.</p>

<p>There was a gasp of wonder at his appearance,
and the men who were still awake sprang to their
feet with their hands on their pistol butts. A second
glance, however, as Bert waved his hand in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
friendly fashion, disarmed them and they came hastily
forward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, stranger,&rdquo; said the man with the badge,
&ldquo;you came in on us rather sudden like and we was
plumb surprised for a minute. You seem to be all
right though, and that machine of yours is certainly
some beaut. We&rsquo;re more used to riding
four-legged things, though. We don&rsquo;t ask anything
about a man&rsquo;s business out here unless we
happen to have some particular business with him,&rdquo;
and he touched his star. &ldquo;So you can tell us nothing
or as much as you like. As to me I ain&rsquo;t got
any secrets as to whom I am. I&rsquo;m the sheriff of
Wentworth County and this here is my posse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just the man I&rsquo;d rather see at this minute than
any one else in the world,&rdquo; exclaimed Bert, delightedly.
And then, in words that tumbled over
one another in their haste, he told them who he
was, how he had been lost on the prairie and of
his adventure near the cabin of &ldquo;Billy the Kid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the mention of that notorious name the
sheriff fairly jumped. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; he shouted.
&ldquo;Billy the Kid and his gang? They&rsquo;re the fellows
we&rsquo;re out for now. Here, boys,&rdquo; he yelled, &ldquo;get
busy. We&rsquo;re on a fresh trail and we&rsquo;ll bag the hull
bunch before daylight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instantly the camp was alive with excitement.
Horses were untethered and saddled, and within
five minutes the posse was ready to start. Bert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
had given hurriedly the details of the plot and the
sheriff&rsquo;s campaign was quickly planned. He knew
every foot of the surrounding country and he
headed his troop straight as the crow flies for Dorsey,
the little town, beyond which lay the tank
where the Limited would slow down to take water.
His line of march was shorter than that of the outlaws,
and besides, they had not planned to leave the
cabin before midnight. He could count on getting
there first and having time to make his dispositions
for the round-up of the gang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, son,&rdquo; he said, with a warm grip of the
hand, when they were ready to start, &ldquo;I sure owe
you a lot for this tip. This country&rsquo;s going to
sleep a heap sight better when they know these
fellows have dangled from the end of a rope. But
how about you, now? I&rsquo;ll send one of my men
along with you to Lonsdale, if you like. That&rsquo;s
fifteen mile west of here and on the line of road
you&rsquo;re traveling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; replied Bert promptly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
with you, if you&rsquo;ll have me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going with us,&rdquo; echoed the sheriff in surprise.
&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;m glad to have you. But that gang
is &lsquo;bad medicine&rsquo; and there&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be some shooting.
You ain&rsquo;t got no call to mix in, &rsquo;cept of your
own free will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, I know,&rdquo; said Bert. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Son,&rdquo; exclaimed the sheriff, extending his hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
&ldquo;put her thar. I&rsquo;m proud to know you. You&rsquo;re
the real stuff, all wool and a yard wide. Come
along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A word of command and they clattered off,
Bert keeping alongside of the leader. He was
thrilling with excitement. The primitive emotions
had him in their grip. A little while before, he
had been in the conventional world of law and order
and civilization. Now, he was seeing life &ldquo;in
the raw.&rdquo; A battle was imminent, and here he was
riding to the battlefield over the prairies at midnight
under the silent stars. The blood coursed
violently through his veins and his heart beat high
with passion for the fight. That he himself was
running the risk of wounding and death was only
an added stimulus. For the moment he was a
&ldquo;cave man,&rdquo; like his ancestors in the morning of
the world, stealing forth from their lair for a raid
against their enemies. Later on, when cooler, he
would analyze and wonder at these emotions. But
now, he yielded to them, and the time seemed long
before the little cavalcade swept through the sleeping
town of Dorsey, and then, at a more slow and
careful pace, made their way to the water tank
below the station.</p>

<p>As they came nearer, they dismounted and led
their horses to a clump of trees on the eastern side
of the tank and a half a mile away. Two men
were left in charge, with orders to strap the horses&rsquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
jaws together, so that they could not neigh and
thus betray their masters. It was figured that the
outlaws would approach from the west, and the
members of the posse disposed themselves in a
wide semicircle, so that, at a given signal, they
could surround and overpower the robbers. If
possible, they were to capture them alive so that
they could answer to justice for their crimes. But,
alive or dead, they were to &ldquo;get&rdquo; them. And as
Bert looked on the stern, determined faces of his
companions, he had no doubt of the outcome of the
struggle.</p>

<p>After they had taken their places, lying flat on
the ground with such shelter as a bush or cactus
plant afforded, there was a considerable wait that
was more trying to the nerves than actual fighting.
Bert and the sheriff were close together, but, except
for an occasional whisper, neither spoke.
They were busy with their thoughts and intent on
the approaching fray.</p>

<p>Perhaps an hour had elapsed before they heard
the distant tramp of horses. Soon they could see
half a dozen men approaching, their figures dimly
outlined in the starlight. The grip of the watchers
tightened on their pistol butts as they strained their
eyes to get a better view of their quarry.</p>

<p>Then silence fell again. A half hour went by.
Suddenly a faint whistle was heard in the distance,
the ground began to tremble and a great headlight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
swung into view, far up the track. It was the
road&rsquo;s crack train, the Overland Limited. The moment
was at hand.</p>

<p>With a terrific rumbling and clanking and ringing
of bells, the ponderous train slowed down at
the tank. The fireman was already on the tender,
ready to slew over the pipe that would bring a
cataract of water down into the reservoir. Just as
he reached for it, there was a fusillade of shots.
Two masked men covered the startled engineer and
fireman with their revolvers and ordered them to
hold up their hands. Another hammered at the
door of the express car and commanded the messenger
to open, on pain of instant death. Farther
down the train other shots rang out and windows
were shattered by bullets to warn passengers
to stay inside.</p>

<p>But just then came a diversion. With a yell and
a rush the sheriff and his men swept down upon
the astonished outlaws, firing as they came. The
bandits were caught like rats in a trap. They were
the center of a ring of flame, but they fought back
savagely. There were cries and curses, as men
emptied their revolvers and then clinched in deadly
struggle. The bandit leader, leaving the express
car, plunged headlong into the fight, battling like
a fiend. When his revolver was empty he flung
it into the sheriff&rsquo;s face and made a break for his
horse. But Bert was too quick for him, and tackled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
him, just as he had put one foot in the stirrup
and was swinging the other over his mount. With
a mighty wrench he dragged him from the saddle.
The &ldquo;Kid&rdquo; uttered a fearful oath and reached for
his knife. Bert&rsquo;s hands closed around his throat
and they went to the ground rolling over and over
like two panthers.</p>

<p>At gun or knife play the outlaw would have
been the victor. But in this hand-to-hand struggle,
Bert was easily his master. His tremendous
strength, reinforced by clean living and athletic
training, soon triumphed over the rum-soaked body
of the &ldquo;Kid.&rdquo; But the latter&rsquo;s ferocity was appalling,
and Bert had to choke him almost into unconsciousness,
before his muscles relaxed and he lay
there limp and gasping.</p>

<p>As Bert rose, breathless but victorious, he saw
that the fight was over. Two of the outlaws were
dead and another fatally wounded. The other
two were in the hands of their captors, and the
sheriff coming up, snapped handcuffs on the &ldquo;Kid&rdquo;
and jerked him to his feet.</p>

<p>Passengers and trainmen came pouring from the
cars, and there was a Babel of excited questionings.
The conductor, full of relief and gratitude at his
train&rsquo;s escape from looting, offered to carry the
party to the next town on the line. But the sheriff
elected to take his prisoners across country to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
county seat, and after another exchange of congratulations,
the train moved on.</p>

<p>Then the triumphant posse, with one of its members
severely, another slightly wounded, took up
their homeward trip. They had made one of the
most important captures in the history of the State,
and the next day the country would be ringing with
their praises. They were naturally jubilant, and
the sheriff urged Bert earnestly to come with them
as the real hero of the roundup. But he stoutly
refused and the only favor he would accept was
the loan of a guide to take him over to Lonsdale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the sheriff at last reluctantly, &ldquo;I
suppose you know your own business best, but I
shore am sorry to say good-bye. You&rsquo;ve made an
awful hit with me, son. That was a lovely scrap
you put up with the &lsquo;Kid,&rsquo; and I&rsquo;ve never seen a
prettier bit of rough housing. I hope you win your
race and I believe you will. Anybody that can put
one over on &lsquo;Billy the Kid&rsquo; can pretty near get anything
he goes after. If ever you&rsquo;re looking for
work,&rdquo; he joked, &ldquo;come out to Wentworth County
and I&rsquo;ll make you assistant sheriff. Perhaps,
though, you&rsquo;d better not,&rdquo; and his eyes twinkled,
&ldquo;cause it wouldn&rsquo;t be long before you&rsquo;d have my
job.&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Murderous Grip</span></h3>


<p class="cap">Bert was having his first glimpse of the sea
since he started on his trip. He was weary
of the land which he had traversed so swiftly and
steadily for two weeks past. The impression
stamped upon his brain was that of an endless ribbon
of road, between whose edges his motorcycle
had sped along, until he seemed like a living embodiment
of perpetual motion. That ribbon had
commenced to unwind at the eastern end of the
continent, and there were still a good many miles to
be reeled off before the race was ended. But now,
as he sat on the veranda of the beach hotel facing
the sea whose surf broke on the sands a hundred
feet away, he could feel his weariness dropping
away like a cast-off garment. The tang of the
ocean was a tonic that filled him with new life, and
his nostrils dilated as they drew in great draughts
of the salt air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ponce de Leon was wrong when he looked for
the elixir of life in a fountain,&rdquo; he thought to himself.
&ldquo;He should have sought for it in the sea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before him stretched the mighty Pacific, its
crested waves glittering in the sun. Fishing vessels
and coasting craft flashed their white sails near<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the shore, while, far out on the horizon, he could
see the trail of smoke that followed in the wake of
a liner. Great billows burst into spray on the
beach, and the diapason of the surf reverberated
in his ears like rich organ music. He drank it all
in thirstily, as though storing up inspiration for the
completion of his task.</p>

<p>A man sitting near by looked at him with a quizzical
smile, frankly interested by Bert&rsquo;s absorption
in the scene before him. With easy good-fellowship,
he remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem to be getting a lot of pleasure out
of the view.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; replied Bert promptly; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get
enough of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are plenty of people who have got
enough of it,&rdquo; he observed drily, &ldquo;your humble servant
among the number.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert scented a story, but repressed any sign of
curiosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the infinite variety that appeals to me,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;The sea is full of wonders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And tragedies,&rdquo; supplemented the other.</p>

<p>He settled back in his chair and lighted a fresh
cigar. As he struck the match, Bert noticed that
his right hand was horribly scarred and disfigured.
It looked as though it had been drawn through a
harrow whose teeth had bitten deep. Great livid
weals crossed each other on the back, and two of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the fingers were gone. And Bert noted that, although
his face and frame indicated that he was
not more than thirty years old, his hair was snowy
white.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Bert, reverting to
the stranger&rsquo;s last remark; &ldquo;storms and shipwrecks
and typhoons and tidal waves are things that have
to be reckoned with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;but I wasn&rsquo;t thinking
especially of these. They&rsquo;re common enough and
terrible enough. What I had in mind was the individual
tragedies that are happening all the time,
and of which not one in a hundred ever hears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you see this hair of mine?&rdquo; he asked, removing
his hat. &ldquo;One day at noon it was as dark
as yours. At three o&rsquo;clock on that same day it was
like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused a moment, as though battling with
some fearful recollection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how familiar you may be with the
Pacific,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;but on this coast there is
every variety of monster that you can find in any
other ocean, and usually of a fiercer and larger
type. Nowhere do you find such man-eating sharks
or such malignant devil-fish. The sharks don&rsquo;t
come near enough to the shore to bother us much.
But it&rsquo;s safe to say that within half a mile from
here, there are gigantic squids, with tentacles from
twelve to twenty feet long. More than one luckless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
swimmer, venturing out too far, has been dragged
down by them, and there are instances where they
have picked a man out of a fishing boat. If those
tentacles ever get you in their murderous grip, it&rsquo;s
all over with you.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, too, we have what is called the &lsquo;smotherer,&rsquo;
something like a monstrous ray, that spreads
itself out over its prey and forces it down in the
mud at the bottom, until it is smothered to death.
It&rsquo;s a terror to divers, and they fear it more than
they do the shark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But these perils are well known and can be
guarded against. If I&rsquo;d got into any trouble with
them, it would probably have been largely my own
fault. But it is the &lsquo;unexpected that happens,&rsquo; and
the thing that marked me for life was something
not much bigger than my fist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you ever seen an abalone? No? Well,
it&rsquo;s a kind of shellfish that&rsquo;s common on this coast.
It has one shell and that a very beautiful one, so
that it is in considerable demand. The inside of it
is like mother of pearl and there are little swellings
on it called &lsquo;blisters,&rsquo; that gleam with all the colors
of the rainbow. It&rsquo;s a favorite sport here to get
up &lsquo;abalone parties,&rsquo; just as you fellows in the East
go crabbing. Only, instead of getting after them
with a net, we use a crowbar. Queer kind of fishing,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say it was,&rdquo; smiled Bert.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, it&rsquo;s this way. The body of the
abalone is a mass of muscle that has tremendous
strength. It is so powerful, that the natives of the
South Sea Islands use the abalones to catch sharks
with. Fact. They fasten a chain to the abalone,
and it swims out and attaches itself to the under
side of a shark. Then they pull it in, and no matter
how hard the shark struggles and threshes
about, it has to come. The abalone would be torn
to pieces before it would let go. It&rsquo;s the bulldog
of the shellfish tribe, and a harpoon wouldn&rsquo;t hold
the shark more securely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the coast, here, they fasten themselves to the
rocks, and as these are usually covered at high tide,
you have to hunt them when the tide is low. You
wade out among the rocks until you catch sight of
an abalone. Then you insert the crowbar between
the shell and the rock. Only the enormous leverage
this gives enables you to pry it off. The strongest
man on earth couldn&rsquo;t pull it away with his bare
hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Usually, we went in parties, and there was a
good deal of rivalry as to who would get the largest
and finest shells. I forgot to say that, besides
the shells themselves, once in a while you can find
a pearl of considerable value and great beauty.
This occurs so seldom, however, that it is always
a red-letter day when you have such a bit of luck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One day, a friend had arranged to go abalone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
hunting with me, but just as we were getting ready
to start out, a telegram called him away from town,
on important business. It would have been the
luckiest thing that ever happened to me if I had
got a telegram too. We were both much disappointed,
as on that day we were going to try a new
place, where we had a &lsquo;hunch&rsquo; that we would make
a good haul.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The weather was so fine and I had my mind so
set upon the trip, that I determined to go it alone.
The tide that day would be at low water mark at
about twelve o&rsquo;clock. I threw a lunch together,
got out my bag and crowbar and started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A tramp of a couple of miles down the beach
brought me to the place we had in mind. It was
a desolate stretch of shore, with no houses in
sight except an occasional fisherman&rsquo;s shack, and
the crowds that frequented the other beaches had
left this severely alone. It was this, added to the
fact that an unusual number of rocks was visible
at low tide, that had made us fix on it as a promising
location.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The day was bright and clear and the sea had
never appeared so beautiful. Looked to me, I
imagine, a good deal as it did to you just now. It
has never seemed beautiful to me since.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The tide was on the ebb, but had not yet run
out fully, and I had to wait perhaps half an hour
before the rocks were uncovered enough to permit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
me to see the abalones in their hiding places. I
spent the time lying lazily on the sand with half
shut eyelids, and basking in the inexpressible charm
of sea and sky. I never dreamed of the horror the
scene would inspire in me a little later on. There
was a long swell but little surf that day, and there
was nothing cruel in the way the waves danced in
the sunlight and came gliding up, with an air that
was almost caressing, to where I lay stretched out
at perfect peace with myself and the world.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soon the ebb had reached its limit and there
was that momentary hesitation before the tide, as
though it had forgotten something and were coming
back for it, began to flow in. Now was the
time, if I wanted to fill the sack that I had brought
along with me to hold my spoil. I remember
chuckling to myself, as I looked around and saw
that there was not a soul in sight. If this should
prove the rich hunting ground I believed it to be,
I would have first choice of the finest specimens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I slung the bag over my shoulder and holding
the crowbar in my left hand, began to make my
way out to the rocks. I had stripped off my outer
clothing, and was in the swimming suit that I wore
underneath. The water was deliciously refreshing,
after the sun bath I had been enjoying, and I went
leisurely along until I came to where the rocks were
thickest. The slope was very gradual, and, by the
time I got among them, I was some distance from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the shore. Then I became alert and alive, and buckled
down to my work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My friend and I had made no mistake. The
rocks were full of abalones and my bag was soon
filling rapidly. I exulted in the thought of the
virgin field that we too would exploit together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, although the shells were numerous and unusually
fine in their markings, I could not find any
that contained a pearl. That was the one thing
necessary to make my day a perfect success. I began
to hustle now, as the tide was beginning to
come in strongly, and before long the rising waters
would cover the rocks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Suddenly, I saw under the green surface a large
abalone with its shell gaping widely. And my
heart gave a jubilant leap as I saw a large pearl
just within the edge of the shell. How I came to
do such a fool thing I don&rsquo;t know, but, with a
shout, I reached out my hand to grasp it. I slipped
as I did so, and, in trying to steady myself, the
crowbar flew out of my left hand and fell several
feet away. And just then the shell began to tighten.
I tried to withdraw my hand, but it was too late.
That closing shell held it against the rock as though
in an iron clamp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sweat broke out all over me and icy chills
chased themselves up and down my spine. I pulled
with all my might, but the shell, as though in
mockery, closed tighter. The feeling of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
clammy mass of gristle and muscle against the
flesh filled me with a sick loathing that, for the moment,
overbore the pain of my crushed hand. So,
I imagine, a man might feel in the slimy folds of
a boa constrictor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Instinctively, I raised my other hand, as if to
insert the crowbar. Then I realized that it had
fallen from my hand. I could see where it lay between
two rocks, not six feet away. Six feet! It
might as well have been six miles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was trapped. The full horror of my situation
burst upon me. I was alone, held fast by that
powerful shell that recognized me as an enemy
and would never relax of its own accord. <i>And the
tide was coming in.</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;In a fury of rage and terror, I struck at the
abalone with my left hand while with all my
strength I tried to tear away my right. But I could
have as soon succeeded in pulling it from beneath
a triphammer. There were gaping rents in the
flesh opened by my struggles and I could see my
blood mingling with the green water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have heard of bears and lynxes caught in
traps who have chewed at their imprisoned leg until
they left it behind them and hobbled away,
maimed and bleeding, but free. I swear to you
that I would have done the same with that hand of
mine, if I had been able.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought of a woodsman whom I knew, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
had been caught by a falling tree that had crushed
his foot. He knew that if he stayed there that
night, the wolves would get him. His axe was
within reach and he deliberately chopped off his
foot. I didn&rsquo;t have even that chance. I was in
my bathing suit and my knife was in the clothes
left on the shore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And all this time the cruel, treacherous sea was
coming in and the tide was mounting higher and
higher. It purled about me softly, gently, like a
cat playing with a mouse. I beat at it angrily with
my left hand and it seemed to laugh. It felt sure
of me and could afford to be indulgent. It was already
above my waist and my knowledge of the
coast told me that when it reached the flood it
would be ten feet deep at the place where I stood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I looked wildly around, in the hope of seeing
some one on the shore. But it was absolutely deserted.
A little while before, I had been gloating
over the fact that I was alone and could have a
monopoly of the hunting. Now I would have
given all I had in the world for the sight of a
human face. I shouted until I was hoarse, but no
one came. Far out at sea, I could glimpse
dimly the sails of a vessel. I waved my free hand
desperately, but I knew at the time that it was futile.
I was a mere speck to any one on board, and
even if they trained strong glasses on me they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
would have thought it nothing but the frolicsome
antics of a bather.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now the water was up to my armpits. The
thought came to me that if I should keep perfectly
quiet, the abalone might think his danger gone and
loosen his grip. But, though I nearly went crazy
with the terrible strain of keeping still, when every
impulse was to leap and yell, the cunning creature
never relaxed that murderous clutch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I lost all control of myself. It wasn&rsquo;t the
thought of death itself. I could, I think, have
steeled myself to that. But it was the horrible
mode of death. To be young and strong and
twenty, and to die there, slowly and inexorably,
while six feet away was a certain means of rescue!</p>

<p>&ldquo;The water had reached my neck. My overstrung
nerves gave way. I tugged wildly at my
bleeding hand. I raved and wept. I think I must
have grown delirious. I dimly remember babbling
to the iron bar that I could see lying there so serenely
in the transparent water. I coaxed it,
wheedled it, cajoled it, begged it to come to me,
and, when it refused, I cursed it. The waves were
breaking over me and I was choking. The spray
was in my eyes and ears. I thought I heard a
shouting, the sound of oars. Then a great blackness
settled down upon me and I knew nothing
more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When next I came to consciousness, I was in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
hospital, where I had been for two months with
brain fever. They had had to take off two fingers,
and barely saved the rest of the hand. They
wouldn&rsquo;t let me see a mirror until they had prepared
me for the change in my appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I learned then the story of my rescue. A party
had come around a bend of the shore when I was
at my last gasp. They caught sight of my hand
just above the water. They made for me at once
and tried to pull me into the boat. Then they saw
my plight, and, with a marlinspike, pried the abalone
loose. They tell me that my bleeding fingers
had stiffened around the pearl, and they could
scarcely get it away from me. They asked me
afterward if I cared to see it, but I hated it so bitterly
that I refused to look at it. It had been
bought at too high a price.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;do you wonder that
I dread that sleek and crawling monster that I call
the sea?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert drew a long breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, and there was a world of sympathy
and understanding in his tone, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Desperate Chances</span></h3>


<p class="cap">Bert&rsquo;s stay at the pleasant seaside hotel was
limited to a few hours only, but he gained
incalculable refreshment from the short rest. It
was with regret that he could not spend more time
there that he took leave of the proprietor, and repaired
to the motorcycle store where he had left
the &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo; to have some very necessary
work done on it. The engine had not been overhauled
since starting from New York, and the
cylinders were badly incrusted with carbon. He
had left directions for this to be scraped out, and
when he reached the shop expected to find his machine
waiting for him in first-class condition.
What was his chagrin therefore, when, on entering
the place, the first thing he saw was the &ldquo;Blue
Streak&rdquo; in a dismantled condition, parts of it
strewn all over the floor.</p>

<p>He hunted up the proprietor, and indignantly
asked him why the machine was not ready according
to promise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry,&rdquo; the man told him, &ldquo;but as one
of the mechanics was scraping the front cylinder
it dropped on the floor, and when he picked it up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
he found it was split. So we can&rsquo;t do anything
with the machine until we get a new cylinder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But haven&rsquo;t you got a machine in the place you
could take a cylinder from, and put it on my machine?&rdquo;
asked Bert. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t afford to be held up
here for a day while you send away for a new part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a machine in the place that would
have a cylinder to fit yours,&rdquo; said the proprietor;
&ldquo;if it had been a rear cylinder, it would have been
easy enough to give you another, because we could
take one off a one-cylinder machine that would fit.
But, as it happens, I haven&rsquo;t a twin cylinder machine
in the place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how long will it take to get the new one
here?&rdquo; asked Bert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About half a day, I should say,&rdquo; replied the
other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Half a day!&rdquo; echoed Bert, and his heart sank.
&ldquo;Why, if I lose that much time here it probably
means that I&rsquo;ll lose the race. Do you realize
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what we can do about it,&rdquo; replied
the proprietor, shrugging his shoulders. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get
the cylinder for you the first minute I can, but that&rsquo;s
the best I can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bert saw that there was no use arguing the matter.
He walked out of the place without another
word, but with a great bitterness in his heart. All
his days of heartbreaking riding&mdash;the hardships he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
had undergone&mdash;the obstacles he had faced and
overcome&mdash;all these things were in a fair way of
being set at nought because of the carelessness of a
stupid mechanician. The thought almost drove
him frantic, and he hurried along the pavement,
scarcely noticing where he was going. At last he
collected his thoughts somewhat and pulled himself
together. Looking about him, he saw that he
was not far from the postoffice, and it occurred to
him that there might be a letter for him from Tom
or Dick.</p>

<p>With this thought in mind he entered the postoffice,
in one corner of which there was also a telegraph
station.</p>

<p>Walking up to the window, he inquired if there
was any mail for Bert Wilson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the functionary behind the grating,
&ldquo;but there&rsquo;s a telegram just come in for a party of
that name. Bill!&rdquo; he called, to the telegraph operator,
&ldquo;here&rsquo;s Mr. Wilson now, him that you just
got the telegram for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; replied the operator, &ldquo;here you
are, sir. I was just going to send it up to your
hotel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Much obliged,&rdquo; said Bert, and tore open the
yellow envelope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ride fast,&rdquo; it read, &ldquo;have just heard Hayward
is within three hundred miles of San Francisco.
Hurry.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>The slip of yellow paper dropped from Bert&rsquo;s
nerveless fingers. Three hundred miles away.
Why, Bert was as far from San Francisco as that
himself, with mountainous roads still before him,
and his machine out of commission!</p>

<p>If he could only do something, anything, that
would be a relief. But he was absolutely helpless
in the grasp of an unforeseen calamity, and all he
could do was to pray desperately for the speedy
arrival of the new cylinder.</p>

<p>He hastened back to the repair shop, and found
that in his absence everything, with, of course, the
exception of the front cylinder, had been put together.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done all we can,&rdquo; the proprietor
assured him. &ldquo;A few minutes ago I called up the
agents in Clyde and they said that their man was
on the way with it. So it ought to get here early
this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; declared Bert grimly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going
to stir out of this place till it does come, let me
tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He waited with what patience he could muster,
and at last, a little before two o&rsquo;clock, the long-awaited
cylinder arrived. With feverish haste Bert
fastened it to the motor base himself, too impatient
to let anybody else do it. Besides, he was resolved
to take no chances of having <i>this</i> cylinder damaged.
Ten minutes later the last nut had been
tightened, and the &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo; was wheeled out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
into the street. Now that the heartbreaking waiting
was over, Bert felt capable of anything. As
he vaulted into the saddle, he made a compact with
himself. &ldquo;If my machine holds out,&rdquo; he resolved,
&ldquo;I will not sleep again until I reach San Francisco;&rdquo;
and when Bert made a resolution, he kept it.</p>

<p>He scorched through the streets of the town regardless,
for the time being, of local speed ordinances.
In a few minutes he was out on the open
road, and then,&mdash;well, the &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo; justified
all the encomiums he had ever heaped upon it. Up
hill and down he sped, riding low over the handlebars,
man and machine one flying, space-devouring
unit. The day drew into dusk, dusk changed to
darkness, and Bert dismounted long enough to
light his lamp and was off again, streaking over the
smooth road like a flying comet. At times he
slowed down as he approached curves, but was off
again like the wind when he had rounded them.
Sometimes steep hills confronted him, but the
speeding motorcycle took them by storm, and
topped their summits almost before gravity could
act to slacken his headlong speed. Then the descent
on the other side would be a wild, dizzy rush,
when at time the speedometer needle reached the
ninety mark.</p>

<p>But the country became more mountainous after
a while, and Bert encountered hills that even the
&ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo; was forced to negotiate on low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
speed. This ate up gasoline, and about midnight
Bert, on stopping a moment to examine his fuel
supply, found that it was almost exhausted. Fortunately,
however, about a mile further on he
reached a wayside garage. He knocked repeatedly,
but received no answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just the same, I&rsquo;ve got to have gasoline,&rdquo;
thought Bert, and acted accordingly. With a
screwdriver he pried open a window, and, filling a
can from a barrel, returned to his machine and
filled the tank. Then he replaced the can, and left
the price of the gasoline in a prominent place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Needs must when the devil drives,&rdquo; he thought,
&ldquo;and I simply had to have that juice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And now he was once more flying through the
night, the brilliant rays from his lamp dancing and
flickering on the road ahead, and at times striking
prismatic colors from rocky walls as the road
passed through some cut. Mile after mile passed
back under the flying rider and machine, but still
they kept on with no sign of slackening. Gradually
dawn broke, misty and gray at first, but then
brightening and expanding until the glorious light
of full day bathed the hills in splendor. And then,
as Bert looked up and around, slowing down so
that he could the better drink in the glorious scene,
he beheld, at a great distance, the roofs and towers
of a great city, and knew that it was San Francisco,
the golden city of the West. Sixteen days since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
he left New York and the goal toward which he
had struggled so bravely was at hand!</p>

<p>But even now there was no time to be lost. At
this moment, Hayward might also be approaching
the city, and Bert was too wise to risk failure now
with the prize so nearly within his grasp. He
started on again, his mind in a whirl, and all
thought of fatigue and exhaustion banished. The
road was bordered by signs indicating the right
direction, and in less than an hour Bert was riding
through the suburbs of San Francisco.</p>

<p>Bert&rsquo;s entrance into the city was signalized by
a display of the wildest enthusiasm on the part of
a big crowd that had turned out to meet the winner.
The details of the thrilling transcontinental
race in which he had been engaged had received
their due share of space in the big dailies, and his
adventures and those of the other contestants had
been closely followed by every one possessing a
drop of red blood in his veins.</p>

<p>Bert was totally unprepared for such a reception,
however, and it took him by surprise. He had
been through many adventures and had encountered
many obstacles, but had pulled through by
dint of indomitable will and pluck. But, as he
afterward confessed to Tom and Dick, he now
felt for the first time like running away. But he
soon abandoned this idea, and chugged slowly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
along until at last he was forced by the press of
people about him to stop.</p>

<p>When he dismounted he was deluged by a flood
of congratulations and good wishes, and was besieged
by a small army of newspaper men, each
anxious to get Bert&rsquo;s own account of the race. It
was some time before he could proceed, but at last
he started on, surrounded by a contingent of motorcycles,
ridden by members of local clubs. They
went slowly along, until in due time they reached
the city hall. Bert was ushered into the presence
of the mayor, who received him with great cordiality,
and after a few words read the letters Bert
handed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Wilson,&rdquo; he said, when he had mastered
their contents, &ldquo;I am certainly glad to know
you, and I only wish you were a native of this
State. We need a few more young men of your
sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged for your good opinion, your
Honor, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; replied Bert, and after answering
many questions regarding his trip, took his
departure.</p>

<p>Returning to the street, he mounted his machine,
and, still accompanied by the friendly motorcyclists,
proceeded to the hotel at which he had arranged
to stop during his stay in San Francisco.
Of course, Tom and Dick were there to meet him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and hearty were the greetings the three comrades
exchanged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It hardly seems possible that I&rsquo;ve won at last,&rdquo;
said Bert. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t sure that Hayward hadn&rsquo;t
beaten me in, until I heard the crowds cheering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you won, all right,&rdquo; Dick assured him,
&ldquo;but you didn&rsquo;t have much time to spare. I just
heard somebody say that Hayward got in not five
minutes ago. I&rsquo;ll bet he nearly went crazy when
he heard that you&rsquo;d beaten him in spite of his
crooked work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, when I learned what kind of a fellow he
was, I just <i>had</i> to beat him,&rdquo; said Bert, with a
smile.</p>

<p>Dick and Tom took charge of his machine, and
stored it safely in the local agency, where it was
immediately hoisted into the show window and excited
much attention.</p>

<p>By the time they returned to the hotel, Bert had
answered the questions of a number of newspaper
men, taken a much-needed bath, and dressed.</p>

<p>In his well-fitting clothes, that set off his manly
figure, he looked a very different person from the
dusty, travel-stained young fellow he had been but
a short time before, and he was delighted to feel
that for a little while he was &ldquo;out of uniform.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Tom and Dick immediately collared him,
and, as he professed himself &ldquo;fresh as a daisy,&rdquo;
took him out to see some of the town. They had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
not gone far before they were recognized by one
of the riders who had formed Bert&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bodyguard&rdquo;
during his ride to the mayor&rsquo;s office. He introduced
himself as John Meyers. Nothing less than
their immediately paying a visit to his club would
satisfy him, they found, so at last they gave in and
told him to &ldquo;lead on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other laughingly complied. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t far
from here,&rdquo; he assured them, &ldquo;and if you like our
looks we&rsquo;ll be glad to have you stay to dinner.
After that, if you&rsquo;re not too fagged, a few of us
will be glad to take you around and show you the
sights. We&rsquo;re all proud of it, and we want visitors
to see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That programme listens good,&rdquo; replied Bert,
&ldquo;and we&rsquo;re &lsquo;on,&rsquo; as far as the dinner goes. After
that, though, I think I&rsquo;ll be about ready to turn
in. I was riding all last night, and I feel like
sleeping without interruption for the next week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s just as you say,&rdquo; agreed Meyers,
&ldquo;but here we are now. Pretty nifty building,
don&rsquo;t you think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was indeed a handsome house into which he
presently ushered them, and they soon saw that its
interior did not belie its outward appearance. The
rooms were large, and furnished comfortably and
in good taste.</p>

<p>In the front room several fine looking young fellows
were engaged in a laughing conversation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
They broke off when they caught sight of Meyers
and the three strangers with him. Introductions
were soon made, and the three comrades found
themselves made thoroughly at home.</p>

<p>Of course, the chief topic of conversation was
Bert&rsquo;s journey, and he answered questions until
he was tired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, fellows,&rdquo; said Meyers, perceiving this,
&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ve cross-examined Wilson enough for
the present. Anyway, dinner&rsquo;s ready, and we&rsquo;ll
see if you can eat as well as you can ride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lead me to it,&rdquo; exclaimed Bert, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as hungry
as a wolf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were soon seated around a table on which
was set forth a substantial meal, and it is almost
needless to say that they all did it ample justice.</p>

<p>During the meal the chief topic of discussion,
next to Bert&rsquo;s record-breaking feat, was the forthcoming
race at the big saucer track, in which riders
from all over the world were to compete.</p>

<p>Bert listened with great attention, for it was of
the most vital importance to him to know as much
as possible of the track on which he was scheduled
to pit his skill and courage against the best and
most experienced motorcyclists of the globe. Of
course, he would be given ample time to practice
and learn the tricks of the big saucer for himself,
but his experience of life so far had taught him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
not to neglect even the slightest bit of knowledge
that might make for success.</p>

<p>In due course of time the meal was despatched,
and they returned to the lounging room. A couple
of pleasant hours were spent in conversation and
joking, and swapping tales of eventful rides under
every conceivable condition of sunshine and
storm.</p>

<p>At last Bert rose, and said, &ldquo;Well, boys, I&rsquo;ve
certainly enjoyed my visit, but I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll have
to make a break&rdquo;&mdash;consulting his watch. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
had a mighty hard time of it lately, and I&rsquo;m about
all in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shook hands all around, and with many expressions
of friendship from the club members and
amid hearty invitations to call again, Bert and
his companions took their departure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll begin practicing at the track
pretty soon now, won&rsquo;t you, Bert?&rdquo; asked Tom,
as they turned their steps toward the hotel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You suppose right, old timer,&rdquo; said Bert, slapping
him affectionately on the shoulder, &ldquo;to-morrow,
or maybe the day after, I&rsquo;ll get down to business.
I want to know that track as well as I know
the back yard at home before the day of the race.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t know too much about it, that&rsquo;s certain,&rdquo;
said Dick, soberly. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t had much
practice in that sort of racing, Bert, and I&rsquo;m almost
afraid to have you try it.&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; laughed Bert, &ldquo;why, I&rsquo;ll be safer
there than I would be dodging autos on Broadway,
back in little old New York. Don&rsquo;t worry about
me. I&rsquo;ll put the jody sign on all of them, provided,
of course, that my machine doesn&rsquo;t take it into its
head,&mdash;or into its gasoline tank&mdash;to blow up, or
something else along the same line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven forbid,&rdquo; ejaculated Dick, piously, &ldquo;but
I guess we&rsquo;d better change the subject. It isn&rsquo;t a
very cheerful one at best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; agreed Bert, &ldquo;but those
club fellows gave me some good tips regarding the
track. They seem to know what they&rsquo;re talking
about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re a great crowd,&rdquo; said Tom, enthusiastically,
&ldquo;and they know how to do things up right,
too. They certainly gave us a fine dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt about it,&rdquo; concurred Bert, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s
made me feel mighty sleepy. I haven&rsquo;t slept in so
long that I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve forgotten how.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, here we are at the hotel, anyway,&rdquo;
laughed Dick, &ldquo;so you&rsquo;ll soon have the chance to
find out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a little more conversation they parted and
went to their rooms.</p>

<p>The last thing Bert heard as he dropped off to
sleep was the strident cry of a newsboy. &ldquo;Wuxtra!
Wuxtra! All about Wilson winning the
transcontinental race. Wuxtra! Wuxtra!&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Wonderful City</span></h3>


<p class="cap">&ldquo;And now for the Exposition,&rdquo; cried Bert,
as after a solid sleep and an equally solid
breakfast they reached their rooms and looked
out over the city glittering in the morning sun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For your Exposition,&rdquo; corrected Tom. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
he went on, as he noted Bert&rsquo;s look of surprise,
&ldquo;that&rsquo;s exactly what I mean. For if it hadn&rsquo;t been
for you, when you discovered the plot to blow up
the Panama Canal, there would have been no Exposition
at all, or, at any rate, a very different
one from this. The bands would have been playing
the &lsquo;Dead March in Saul,&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;Hail
Columbia&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Star-Spangled Banner.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nor was Tom far from the truth. Before the
minds of the boys came up that night in Panama,
when Bert, crouching low beneath the window of
the Japanese conspirators, had overheard the plot
to destroy the great Canal. They saw again the
struggle in the library; the fight for life in the
sinking boat in the Caribbean Sea; the rescue by
the submarine and the cutting of the wires that led
to the mined gate of the Gatun Locks. Had it
not been for Bert&rsquo;s quick wit and audacity, the
carefully-planned plot of the Japanese Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
to keep the larger part of the American fleet
on the Atlantic side, while they themselves made a
dash for the Pacific slope, might easily have succeeded,
and, at the very moment the boys were
speaking, the whole country west of the Rocky
Mountains might have been fast in the grip of the
Japanese armies. But the discovery of the plot
had been its undoing. The matter had been
hushed up for official reasons, and only a very few
knew how nearly the two nations had been locked
in a life and death struggle for the control of the
Western ocean.</p>

<p>And now the peril was over. Never again
would the United States be caught napping. War
indeed might come&mdash;it probably would, some time&mdash;but
America&rsquo;s control of the coast was assured.
At Colon on the Atlantic side and Panama at the
Pacific end, impregnable forts and artillery bade
defiance to all the fleets of East or West. Great
navies on either side would be kept in easy reach
in case of attack, and the combined land and sea
forces would be invincible against any combination
likely to be brought against them.</p>

<p>And it was this great achievement of American
enterprise&mdash;the opening of the Canal&mdash;that the
Exposition, now in full swing, was intended to celebrate.
Its official designation was the &ldquo;Panama-Pacific
International Exposition.&rdquo; And it was fitting
that it should be held at San Francisco, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Queen City of the West, because it was of preëminent
importance to the Pacific slope.</p>

<p>For this silver strip of water, fifty miles long,
that stretched between the Atlantic and Pacific,
brought the West nine thousand miles nearer to
Europe by water than it had been before. The
long journey round the Horn, fraught with danger
and taking months of time, would henceforth be
unnecessary. It gave an all-water route that saved
enormously in freights, and enabled shipments to
be made without breaking bulk. It diverted a vast
amount of traffic that had hitherto gone through
the Suez Canal. It gave a tremendous impetus to
the American merchant marine and challenged the
right of Great Britain longer to &ldquo;rule the waves.&rdquo;
And, by enabling the entire naval strength of the
country to be assembled quickly in case of need,
it assured the West against the &ldquo;yellow peril&rdquo; that
loomed up on the other side of the sea.</p>

<p>But, above and apart from the local interests involved,
was the patriotic rejoicing in which all the
nation shared. The American Eagle felt that it
had a right to scream over the great achievement.
For great it certainly was&mdash;one of the most marvelous
in the history of the world. The dream of
four hundred years had become a realized fact.
Others had tried and failed. France with her
scientific genius and unlimited resources had
thrown up her hands in despair. Then America<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
had taken it up and carried it through to a glorious
conclusion. Four hundred millions of dollars had
been expended on the colossal work. But this was
not the most important item. What the country
was proud of was the pluck, the ingenuity, the determination,
that in the face of all kinds of dangers&mdash;dangers
of flood, of pestilence, of earthquakes,
of avalanche&mdash;had met them all in a way
to win the plaudits of mankind.</p>

<p>In the case of the boys, this pride was, of course,
intensified by the fact that they had visited the
country and seen its wonders at first hand. From
Colon to Panama, from the Gatun Dam to the
Miraflores Locks, they had gone over every foot
of ground and water. Its gates, its cuts, its spillways,
its tractions&mdash;all of these had grown familiar
by actual inspection. Add to this the exulting
consciousness that they had been concerned in
its salvation, when threatened by their country&rsquo;s
foes, and it can readily be imagined how eager
they were to see all the wonders of the Exposition
that was to celebrate its completion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to be a pretty big thing to satisfy my
expectations,&rdquo; said Dick, as they neared the
grounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Bert, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen a
world&rsquo;s fair, but, from what I&rsquo;ve heard, this goes
ahead of all of them. Even the Chicago Fair,
they say, can&rsquo;t hold a candle to it. A fellow was
telling me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>But just then, as they turned a curve, they came
in full view of the grounds, and stopped short with
a gasp of admiration.</p>

<p>It was a magnificent picture&mdash;a splendid gem,
with the California land and sky as its setting.</p>

<p>A glorious city had sprung up as though by the
waving of an enchanter&rsquo;s wand. On every side
rose towers, spires, minarets and golden domes.
The prosaic, every-day world had vanished, and,
in its place had come a dream city such as might
have been inspired by the pages of the &ldquo;Arabian
Nights.&rdquo; It almost seemed as though a caravan
laden with silks and spices of the East might be
expected at any moment to thread the courts and
colonnades, or a regiment of Janissaries, with
folded fez and waving scimitars, spur their horses
along the road. The very names of the buildings
were redolent of romance. There was the &ldquo;Court
of the Four Seasons,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Court of the Sun and
Stars,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Tower of Jewels&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Hall of
Abundance.&rdquo; And the illusion was heightened by
the glorious sunshine and balmy air that makes San
Francisco the Paradise of the Western Continent.</p>

<p>The Exposition grounds, covering a vast extent
of space, had been chosen with marvelous taste and
judgment and a keen eye for the picturesque. The
finest talent to be found anywhere had been expended
on the location, the approaches and the
grouping of the buildings, so as to form a harmonious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
combination of grace and fitness and
beauty. It was a triumph of architecture and
landscape gardening. Nature and art had been
wedded and the result was bewildering and overpowering.
It had never been approached by any
Exposition in the world&rsquo;s history.</p>

<p>The site was a level space surrounded on east,
west and south by sloping hills. Standing on these
heights, one looked down as upon a vast amphitheater.
On the north it faced the waters of San
Francisco Bay, the waves gleaming in the sun and
the sea lions playing about the rocks of the Golden
Gate. Across the Bay could be seen towering
mountains, their summits alternately shrouded in
a tenuous haze and glistening in golden glory.</p>

<p>On the harbor side was an esplanade, eighteen
hundred feet long and three hundred feet wide,
adorned with marble statues and gorgeous foliage
and plashing fountains. Opening directly from
this was the main group of palaces&mdash;fitly so called&mdash;devoted
to the more important objects of the
Fair. These were clustered about the great Court
of the Sun and Stars. Around the Court stood
over one hundred pillars, each surmounted by a
colossal figure representing some particular star.
Upon a huge column stood a globe, symbol of the
Sun, and about the column itself was a spiral ascent,
typifying the climbing hopes and aspirations
of the human race. Nearby rose the splendid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
Tower of Jewels, four hundred and fifty feet in
height, its blazing dome reflecting back the rays
of the sun, while jewels set in the walls&mdash;agate,
beryl, garnet and chrysolite&mdash;bathed the interior
in luminous splendor.</p>

<p>The Court of the Four Seasons was designed
to show the conquest of man over the forces of
nature. The Hall of Abundance overflowed with
the rich products brought from the four corners of
the earth. The East and West were typified by
two groups, one showing the customs of the Orient
and the other exhibiting the progress made by
Western civilization. Between them stood a prairie
schooner, emblem of the resistless tide of immigration
toward the setting sun.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Westward the course of empire takes its way,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The first four acts already past;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fifth shall close the drama and the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Time&rsquo;s noblest offspring is its last,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noi">murmured Dick, yielding to his chronic habit of
quotation.</p>

<p>Besides the central group of palaces devoted to
machinery, invention, transportation and the fine
arts, there were two other sections. One held the
buildings of the various States and the official
headquarters of foreign nations. The other was
given over to the amusement concessions, consisting
of hundreds of pavilions that catered to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
pleasures of the visitors. Then, too, there was a
great arena for open air sports and competitions.
Scattered everywhere were sunken lakes and rippling
cascades and verdant terraces, so arranged
that at every turn the eye was charmed by some
new delight.</p>

<p>But the transcendent beauty of the Fair when
viewed by day yielded the palm to the glory of the
night. As the dusk fell, thousands upon thousands
of lights, like so many twinkling jewels, sprang
into being. The splendor flashed on tree and
building, spire and minaret, arch and dome, until
the whole vast Exposition became a crystal dream.
Great searchlights from the bay played on jets of
steam rising high in the sky, in a perfect riot of
changing color. The lagoons and fountains and
cascades sent back the shimmering reflections
multiplied a thousand fold. And beneath the
witchery of those changing lights, one might well
imagine himself transported to some realm of
mystery and romance a thousand leagues from the
Western Hemisphere and the twentieth century.</p>

<p>But, although the boys felt and yielded to the
potent spell that the Exposition cast on those that
came within its gates, they none the less devoted
themselves to the wonders shown in the great
buildings set apart for machinery and inventions.
All of them were planning their life work on
scientific and engineering lines, and they were keen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
for the new discoveries and appliances that were
seen on every hand in almost endless profusion.
Wireless telegraphy, aeroplanes, submarine and
motor engines&mdash;these were the magnets that drew
them irresistibly. Although they had prided themselves
on keeping pretty well up to date along these
lines, they were astonished to see how many things
came to them now with the force of a revelation.</p>

<p>Before the models of the submarines they stood
for a long time, as they took in every detail of the
plan and construction. And with Bert&rsquo;s admiration
was mingled a sense of gratitude. One of
these it was that had picked him up when he was
battling with the waves and hope had almost vanished.
Even now, he could see the saucy little vessel
as it poked its nose into the entrance of the
Canal and darted here and there like a ferret,
sniffing the danger that it came just in time to prevent.
He remembered the fascination of that
memorable trip, as he stood at the porthole and
saw the wonders of the sea, illumined by its powerful
searchlight. But that had simply whetted
his appetite, and he was hungry for further experiences.
Somewhere among his ancestors there
must have been Viking blood, and the haunting
mystery of the sea had always called to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some day, perhaps&rdquo;&mdash;he thought to himself,
and then as he saw the amused expression on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
companions&rsquo; faces, he realized that he had spoken
out loud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Alexander?&rdquo; chaffed Tom.
&ldquo;Weeping for more worlds to conquer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t satisfied with the victories won on the
earth,&rdquo; mocked Dick. &ldquo;He wants the sea, too.
You&rsquo;re a glutton for adventure, Bert.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; laughed Tom, &ldquo;he won&rsquo;t be happy till
he gets it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, cut it out,&rdquo; retorted Bert, a little sheepishly.
&ldquo;Since when did you fellows set up to be mind
readers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But they <i>were</i> mind readers and prophets, too,
though none of them knew it at the time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s still one other field to be explored,&rdquo;
went on Dick, teasingly, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s the air.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked Tom, &ldquo;if Bert&rsquo;s going to try
that, too, he&rsquo;d better get busy pretty soon. They&rsquo;re
going ahead so fast there, that before long there
won&rsquo;t be anything new left to do. When fellows
can turn somersaults in the air and fly along on
their backs, like that Frenchman, Peguod, they&rsquo;re
certainly getting a strangle hold on old mother
Nature. The way things are moving now, a man
will soon be as safe in an airship as a baby in his
cradle. Look at this Bleriot monoplane;&rdquo; and
they were soon plunged deep in the study of the
various types of flying craft.</p>

<p>In another department, one thing gave Bert unlimited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
satisfaction. Among all the motorcycles,
native and foreign, before which he lingered
longer than anywhere else, he saw nothing that excelled
his own. His heart swelled with pride and
confidence, as he realized that none of his competitors
in the coming struggle would have a better
machine beneath him than the &ldquo;Blue Streak.&rdquo; He
could drop any worry on that score. If he failed
to come in first, he himself must shoulder the
blame.</p>

<p>And when at last, tired but happy, they turned
their backs on the dazzling scene and were on their
way back to the hotel, their talk naturally fell on
the topic that was uppermost in their minds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How are you feeling, Bert?&rdquo; asked Tom.
&ldquo;Are you fit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I feel like a two-year-old,&rdquo; was the answer.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hard as nails and right at the top of my form.
I&rsquo;ll have no excuses to offer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t need any,&rdquo; said Dick confidently.
&ldquo;Leave those to the losers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One never can tell,&rdquo; mused Bert. &ldquo;There are
some crack riders in that bunch. But I&rsquo;m going
to do my level best, not only for my own sake, but
so that the foreigners can&rsquo;t crow over us. I&rsquo;d hate
to see America lose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; asserted Tom. &ldquo;Not on the
Fourth of July!&rdquo;</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Winning Fight</span></h3>


<p class="cap">The big motordome was gayly decorated with
flags and bunting, in honor of the Fourth,
and there was just enough breeze stirring to give
them motion. A big military band played patriotic
and popular airs, and, as the spectators filed into
their seats in a never-ending procession, they felt
already the first stirrings of an excitement that was
to make of this a night to be remembered throughout
a lifetime.</p>

<p>An hour before the time scheduled for the race
to begin every seat in grandstand and bleachers
was taken, and people were fighting for a place in
the grassy infield. Very soon, even that was
packed with as many spectators as the managers
felt could be disposed of with safety. They were
kept within bounds by a stout rope fence stretched
between posts. At last every available foot of
space was occupied, and the gates were closed.
Thousands were turned away even then, although
there were over sixty thousand souls within the
stadium.</p>

<p>The motordome had been constructed to hold
an immense crowd, but its designers had never anticipated
anything like this. So great was the interest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
in the event, that most of those who could
not gain admittance camped down near the gates
to get bulletins of the progress of the race, as soon
as possible.</p>

<p>It was an ideal night for such an event. The
air was soft and charged with a thousand balmy
odors. The band crashed out its stirring music,
and made the blood of the most sluggish leap and
glow. Suddenly the arc lights suspended at short
intervals over the track blazed out, making the
whole place as light as day.</p>

<p>Then, as every detail of the track was plainly
revealed, thousands drew a deep breath and shuddered.
The track was banked at an angle of approximately
thirty-eight degrees, with three laps to
the mile. It seemed impossible to many that anything
on wheels could cling to the precipitous slope,
that appeared to offer insecure footing even for a
fly.</p>

<p>Near the bottom, a white band was painted
around the entire circumference, marking the actual
one-third of a mile. At the bottom of the
track there was a level stretch, perhaps four feet
wide, and beyond that the smooth turf, bordered
at a little distance by a dense mass of spectators
confined within the rope fence. Above the track
tier after tier of seats arose.</p>

<p>Opposite the finish line, the starter&rsquo;s and judge&rsquo;s
pavilion was built. Here all the riders and machines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
that were to take part were assembled, and
it presented a scene of the utmost bustle and activity.
Tom and Dick were there, anxiously waiting
for Bert to emerge from his dressing room,
and meanwhile inspecting every nut and bolt on
the &ldquo;Blue Streak.&rdquo; Despite the recent changes
made in it, the faithful motorcycle was still the
same staunch, dependable machine it had always
been, but with even greater speed capabilities than
it had possessed before.</p>

<p>Of course, there were many who claimed that
Bert could never have a chance of winning without
a specially built racer, and he had been urged
a score of times to use such a mount. But he had
refused without the slightest hesitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he always said, &ldquo;I know what the old
&lsquo;Blue Streak&rsquo; will do, just as well as I know what I
am capable of. I know every whim and humor of
it, and just how to get the last ounce of power out
of it. I&rsquo;ve tested it a thousand times. I know
it will stand up to any work I put it to, and I&rsquo;d no
more think of changing machines now than I would
of trying a new system of training two days before
I was to enter a running race. No, thanks, I guess
I&rsquo;ll stick to the old &lsquo;Blue Streak.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick and Tom were still busy with oil can and
wrench when Bert emerged from his dressing-room.
He was dressed in a blue jersey, with an
American flag embroidered on breast and back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
His head was encased in a thick leather helmet,
and a pair of heavy-glassed goggles were pushed
up on his forehead.</p>

<p>He strode quickly over to where his chums were
working on his mount, and they shook hands heartily.
&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; he exclaimed gaily, &ldquo;how is the old
&lsquo;bus&rsquo; to-night? Everything O.K., I hope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sure is,&rdquo; replied Dick. &ldquo;Tom and I have
gone over every inch of it, and it seems in apple-pie
order. We filled your oil tank up with oil
that we tested ourselves, and we know that it&rsquo;s all
right. We&rsquo;re not taking any chances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; exclaimed Bert, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing
more important than good oil. We don&rsquo;t want
any frozen bearings to-night, of all nights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much!&rdquo; agreed Tom, &ldquo;but it must be
pretty nearly time for the start. It&rsquo;s after eight
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Even as he spoke, a gong tapped, and a deep
silence descended on the stadium. Excitement,
tense and breathless, gripped every heart.</p>

<p>A burly figure carrying a megaphone mounted
a small platform erected in the center of the field,
and in stentorian tones announced the conditions
of the race.</p>

<p>Seven riders, representing America, France,
England, Italy, and Belgium, were to compete for
a distance of one hundred miles. The race was to
begin from a flying start, which was to be announced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
by the report of a pistol. The time of
each race was to be shown by an illuminated clock
near the judge&rsquo;s stand.</p>

<p>The man with the megaphone had hardly
ceased speaking when the roar of several motorcycle
exhausts broke forth from the starting platform
and the band crashed into a stirring march.</p>

<p>Then a motorcycle appeared, towing a racer.
Slowly it gathered headway, and at last the rider
of the racing machine threw in the spark. The
motor coughed once or twice, and then took hold.
With a mighty roar his machine shot ahead, gathering
speed with every revolution, and passing the
towing motorcycle as though it were standing still.</p>

<p>In quick succession now, machine after machine
appeared. It was Bert&rsquo;s turn to start, and, pulling
his goggles down over his eyes, he leaped astride
the waiting &ldquo;Blue Streak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go it, old man!&rdquo; shouted Dick and Tom, each
giving him a resounding buffet on the shoulder,
&ldquo;show &rsquo;em what you&rsquo;re made of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave it to me,&rdquo; yelled Bert, for already the
towing motorcycle was towing him and the &ldquo;Blue
Streak&rdquo; out onto the track. They went at a snail&rsquo;s
pace at first, but quickly gathered momentum.</p>

<p>As he came into view of the gathered multitude,
a shout went up that made the concrete structure
tremble. This was repeated twice and then
the spectators settled back, waiting for the start.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>When he felt he was going fast enough, Bert,
by a twist of the right grip, lowered the exhaust
valves, and the next second he felt the old &ldquo;Blue
Streak&rdquo; surge forward as though discharged from
a cannon. It required a speed of fifty miles an
hour even to mount the embankment, but before he
had gone two hundred yards he had attained it.
He turned the front wheel to the slope, and his
machine mounted it like a bird.</p>

<p>Never had he sensed such gigantic power under
him, and he felt exalted to the skies. He forgot
everything in the mad delirium of speed; tremendous,
maddening speed. Every time he opened
the throttle a trifle more he could feel it increase.
Eagerly, resistlessly, his mount tore and raged forward,
whistling through the air with the speed of
an arrow. In a few seconds he was abreast of the
riders who had started first, and who were jockeying
for a good position. There was little time
for manoeuvring, however, for now the riders
were fairly well bunched, and the starter&rsquo;s pistol
cracked. The race had started!</p>

<p>And now Bert found himself competing with
the crack racers of the world. Each was mounted
on the best machine the genius of his countrymen
could produce, and each was grimly resolved to
win. The &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo; and its rider were indeed
in fast company, and were destined to be put to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
test such as seldom occurs in even such strenuous
racing as this.</p>

<p>Bert was riding high on the track at the start,
and he resolved to make use of this position to
gain the lead. He opened the throttle wide, and
the &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo; responded nobly. So great was
the force of the forward spurt that his hands were
almost wrenched from the handlebars. He held
on, however, and at the end of the second lap
was even with the leader, a Frenchman.</p>

<p>Bert turned his front wheel down the slope, and
swooped toward the bottom of the track with a
sickening lurch. A vast sigh of horror went up
from the closely packed stands. But at the last
second, when within a foot of the bottom of the
incline, Bert started up again, and with a speed increased
by the downward rush shot up to the white
band.</p>

<p>He hugged this closely, and reeled off mile after
mile at a speed of close to a hundred miles an
hour. Leaning down until his body touched the
top frame bar, he coaxed ever a little more speed
from the fire-spitting mechanism beneath him.</p>

<p>But the Frenchman hung on doggedly, not ten
feet behind, and a few feet further back the English
entrant tore along. In this order they passed
the fifty-mile mark, and the spectators were standing
now, yelling and shouting. The rest of the
field had been unable to hold the terrific pace, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
had dropped behind. The Belgian entrant had
been forced to drop out altogether, on account of
engine trouble.</p>

<p>The leaders swept on and gradually drew up on
the three lagging riders. A quarter of a lap&mdash;half
a lap&mdash;three-quarters of a lap&mdash;and amid a
deafening roar of shouting from the spectators
Bert swept past them. He had gained a lap on
them!</p>

<p>The English and French entries were still close
up, however, both hanging on within three yards
of Bert&rsquo;s rear wheel. They reeled off mile after
mile, hardly changing their positions by a foot.
Suddenly there was a loud report that sounded
even above the roar of the exhausts, and a second
later Bert fell to the rear. His front tire had
punctured, and it was only by the exercise of all
his skill and strength that he had averted a horrible
accident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over. It&rsquo;s all over,&rdquo; groaned Tom.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s out of the race now. He hasn&rsquo;t got a
chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dick said nothing, but his face was the color of
chalk. He dashed for the supply tent, and
emerged carrying a front wheel with an inflated
tire already on it, just as Bert pulled up in front
of them and leaped from his mount. His eyes
were sunken, with dark rings under them, but his
mouth was set and stern as death.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;On with it, Dick, on with it,&rdquo; he said, in a low,
suppressed voice. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have that wrench, Tom.
Hold up the front fork, will you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He worked frantically, and in less than forty
seconds had substituted the new wheel carrying
the inflated tire in place of the old.</p>

<p>Flinging down the wrench, he sprang into the
saddle, and with willing strength Dick and Tom
rushed him and his machine out onto the track,
pushing with all the might of their sinewy young
bodies. At the first possible moment Bert shot on
the power, and the engine, still hot, started instantly.
In a second he was off in wild pursuit of
the flying leaders.</p>

<p>As he mounted the track, he was seen to lean
down and fumble with the air shutter on the carburetor.
Apparently this had little effect, but to
Bert it made all the difference in the world. The
motor had had tremendous strength before, but
now it seemed almost doubled. The whole machine
quivered and shook under the mighty impact
of the pistons, and the hum of the flywheels
rose to a high whine. Violet flames shot from the
exhaust in an endless stream.</p>

<p>The track streamed back from the whirling
wheels like a rushing river. It seemed to be leaping
eagerly to meet him. The lights and shadows
flickered away from him, and the grotesque
shadow cast by his machine weaved rapidly back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
and forth as he passed under the sizzling arc
lights.</p>

<p>The spectators were a yelling mob of temporary
maniacs by this time. The Frenchman and Englishman
had passed the eighty-mile mark, and
Bert was still a lap and a half behind. He was
riding like a fiend, coaxing, nursing his machine,
manipulating the controls so as to wring the last
ounce of energy from the tortured mass of metal
he bestrode.</p>

<p>Slowly, but with deadly persistence, he closed
the gap between him and the leaders. Amidst a
veritable pandemonium from the crazed spectators
he passed them, but still had one lap to make up
in fifteen miles. Shortly after passing them, he
was close on the three remaining competitors, who
were hanging on in the desperate hope of winning
should some accident befall the leaders.</p>

<p>Suddenly, without any warning, something&mdash;nobody
ever learned what&mdash;went wrong. They
became a confused, tangled mass of blazing machine
and crumpled humanity. Bert was not
twenty feet behind them, and men turned white
and sick and women fainted. It seemed inevitable
that he would plow into them traveling at that
terrific pace, and add one more life to the toll of
the disaster.</p>

<p>Bert&rsquo;s mind acted like a flash. He was far down
on the track, and could not possibly gain a position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
above the wreckage, and so skirt it in that way.
Nor did he have time to pass beneath it, for men
and machines were sliding diagonally down the
steep embankment.</p>

<p>With a muttered prayer, he accepted the last
chance fate had seen fit to leave him. He shot off
the track completely, and whirled his machine onto
the turf skirting it.</p>

<p>The grass was smooth, but, at Bert&rsquo;s tremendous
speed, small obstacles seemed like mountains.
The &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo; quivered and bounded, at times
leaping clear off the ground, as it struck some uneven
place. For what seemed an age, but was in
reality only a few seconds, Bert kept on this, and
then steered for the track again. If his machine
mounted the little ridge formed by the beginning
of the track proper, all might yet be well, if not&mdash;well,
he refused to even think of that.</p>

<p>The front wheel hit the obstruction, and, a fraction
of a second later, the rear wheel struck. The
machine leaped clear into the air, sideways. Bert
stiffened the muscles of his wrists until they were
as hard as steel, to withstand the shock of landing.
The handlebars were almost wrenched from his
control, but not quite, and once more he was tearing
around with scarcely diminished speed.</p>

<p>By great good fortune, the riders involved in
the accident had not been hurt seriously, although
their machines were total wrecks, and they hobbled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
painfully toward the hospital tent, assisted
by spectators who had rushed to their aid.</p>

<p>Bert was now less than half a lap behind the
flying leaders, but he had only four miles in which
to make it up. At intervals now he leaned down
and pumped extra oil into the engine. This added
a trifle of extra power, and as he rushed madly
along the &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo; lived up to its name nobly.
At the beginning of the last mile he was only about
three lengths behind. The vast crowd was on its
feet now, shouting, yelling, tossing hats, gesticulating.
They were worked up to a pitch of frenzy
absolutely indescribable.</p>

<p>As Bert crept grimly up, nearer and nearer, the
place became a veritable Bedlam. Now the racers
had entered the last lap; only a third of a mile to
go, and Bert was still a length behind. The exhaust
of the racing motorcycles united in one
hoarse, bellowing roar, that seemed to shake the
very earth.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;Bert reached down, and with the finish
line but a short hundred yards ahead, opened wide
the air shutter on the carburetor. His machine
seemed to almost leave the track, and then, tearing
forward, passed the Frenchman, who was
leading. As he crossed the finish line, Bert was
ahead by the length of a wheel!</p>

<p>The uproar that burst forth then defied all description.
As Bert, after making a circuit of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
track, finally brought the &ldquo;Blue Streak&rdquo; to a standstill,
a seething mob rushed toward him, waving
hats and flags, and shouting frantically and joyfully.</p>

<p>Bert had no mind to get in their well-meaning
clutches, however, so he and his two friends made
a rush for his dressing room, and reached it safely.
The crowd, being unable to locate its hero, and too
excited to make a methodical search for him,
worked off its exuberance by much shouting and
shaking of hands between perfect strangers, and
gradually dispersed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tom and Dick, with strong emotion
that they made no effort to conceal, wrung
his hand again and again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You rode the greatest motorcycle race this old
world ever saw, old friend,&rdquo; said Dick at last,
&ldquo;but Tom and I are never going to let you go in
another. The world would be too empty for us
without you.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the sheaf of telegrams of congratulations
handed to Bert next morning was one from Reddy.
It was characteristic:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shamrock. Glory be. I knew you&rsquo;d put it
over. Keep in good shape for football.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He talks as if I were already on the team,&rdquo;
commented Bert; &ldquo;I may not make it, after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Swell chance of your missing it,&rdquo; scoffed Tom.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody knows you&rsquo;re slated for full-back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To another message, Drake&rsquo;s name was
signed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah for the blue. Be back for football in
the Fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A decided football flavor in your telegrams
to-day,&rdquo; grinned Dick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bert, &ldquo;win or lose, I&rsquo;ll be there
with both feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better have both of them with you, for
a fact,&rdquo; drawled Tom. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t do much
without them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And when a few months later, the football
season opened, Bert&rsquo;s promise was fulfilled. How
swift those feet of his proved to be in getting down
the field, how mighty in kicking a goal, how powerful
in every stirring feature of the glorious
game, will be told in</p>

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.</p>

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:</p>

<p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

<p>1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.</p>

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<h3>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<h3>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<h3>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
